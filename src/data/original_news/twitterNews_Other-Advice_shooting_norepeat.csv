bbstats,"@ElGee35 @stephenasmith I mean - the KD not shooting heabes at the buzzer thing is a good example. there's not an easy way to quantify how that ""doesn't help"" his team (since it's an omission) versus if he did do all those heaves. okay I take it back - it is easy - but not super readily done.",,Thu Aug 16 12:44:02 +0000 2018
