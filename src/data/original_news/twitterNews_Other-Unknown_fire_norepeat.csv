theresawinslow2,@xan_desanctis @benshapiro @nytimes President Trump along with me are not seizing on the death of Mollie Tibbets. We're stating a fact. If the illegal immigrant had not been our country her poor family would still have her here to say I love you! I know what it feels like to lose a child. I lost 4 in a house fire.,,Wed Aug 22 15:27:07 +0000 2018

PVdmin,Sam apologizes to Holeigh for talking about the fire that had her family lose everything. Holeigh says it’s not a problem but quotes Scottie throwing Sam UTB. (The quote is true.)
