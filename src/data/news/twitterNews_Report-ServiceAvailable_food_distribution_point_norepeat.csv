Economissive,"@donal_curtin I think the problem with workplace drinks is more about people assuming the least offensive food is the blandest.

So there's the NZ distribution of taste versus, say, India (your point). But the workplace drinks sit at the blandest point in the NZ distribution.",,[3]
QEDdiyZ,"@Xene1042 @robert_zubrin Actually, it doesn't matter even if we assume ""limited resources"" because the problem is distribution https://t.co/sTT9mlid2E Case in point: We produce enough to feed 2 earths, yet half of what's produced in the west gets trashed, while a billion is hungry https://t.co/4v1W7kHve8",,[3]
gosharpshooter,"@Trad89 Anyway my point is that counting macros is not 'basic'. Personally, I'd rather concentrate on overall diet quality with a well balanced distribution of food types that *I* enjoy. The macros take care of themselves. If you wanna count 'em, knock yourself out",,[3]
GAKechnie,"@StephenGutowski Just imagine what this will do to manufacturing, food distribution (yes, you will be able to print food) even drug dealing (it’s very possible that someday you will be able to print out fretanyl).

danielmgmoylan,"@huwbro1 @drlangtry_girl @jillongovt But since you agree there is unlikely to be any interruption in food supplies, I am puzzled why you think this is a point worth making. In 2004 you were dealing with a fuel/distribution crisis, not a supply crisis.",,[3]
alok_bhatt,@Abhiishekji https://t.co/kNrSpALrLy - we had walked in this road and I remember seeing the path leading to the temple- starting point was the the turn prior to the village (in a village school right above that road) where BSF has set up a food distribution camp-forgot the name of the village,,[3]
GuyDorrellEsq,"@BootstrapCook I agree with all of this thread with the exception of the final point; there's adequate food in this country, or foodbanks would be able to help. But the distribution (and cost) is all wrong",,[3]
24LadyLynda,@BootstrapCook @SuffolkLCAudrey Sorry to hear that but I was referring to the distribution &amp; access rather than individual situations. My point was there is enough food it just isn't shared properly IMO.,,[3]

carrieunderpics,@MissMandy126 I disagree with that statement. First of all it is one city banning the distribution or sale of plastic straws in which many fast food chains are starting to do. It’s all about the environment. This will spread across the country at some point because many businesses want it too,,[3]

CliffordParnel2,@sarahwollaston Spot on. A point worth remembering re industry doing the stockpiling for medical supplies or food - they don't have the room in their warehouses for extra stuff to just sit there. Their storage capacity and distribution chain is tightly managed and finely balanced.,,[3]
