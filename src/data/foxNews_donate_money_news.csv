Even recent earthquake Chile resulted $10 million American tax dollars sent there. Now Japan bad shape, columnist Reuters news agency, Felix Salmon, says America send money all. He points Japan rich country massive donations often lead much relief. Haiti good example that. With us now, ""Barack Hard Place"" duo: Monica Crowley Alan Colmes. So Monica, money Japan.

They solid institutions, good government. That's why… O'REILLY: But wealthy nation, also. CROWLEY: Right. O'REILLY: And insurance. And infrastructure. So send $10 bucks in? CROWLEY: I done yet. O'REILLY: But might? CROWLEY: I – I seriously considering it. However, -- here's why. Because lot times disasters happen third-world countries, everybody rushes desperately poor, say Haiti. But I also think disaster happens first world, countries better equipped rebuild richer, mean deserve support moral economic less. O'REILLY: All right. But there's matter deserving there's matter whether lot good. Look, disaster here, Colmes, United States, right, we're getting money anybody. CROWLEY: That's true.
