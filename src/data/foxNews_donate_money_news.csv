When tsunami hit southeast Asia, donated billion taxpayer dollars, count private donations. When earthquake hit Haiti, gave country billion dollars. Even recent earthquake Chile resulted $10 million American tax dollars sent there. Now Japan bad shape, columnist Reuters news agency, Felix Salmon, says America send money all. He points Japan rich country massive donations often lead much relief. Haiti good example that. With us now, ""Barack Hard Place"" duo: Monica Crowley Alan Colmes. So Monica, money Japan. I'm getting lot mail this. The celebrities tweeting it. Celebrities tweeting… MONICA CROWLEY, SYNDICATED RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Yes, I've following Lady Gaga tweeting this.

So pump government money private donations, lot times money goes right drain help people need. Japan different kind situation. It first-world country. It's third-world country. They solid institutions, good government. That's why… O'REILLY: But wealthy nation, also. CROWLEY: Right. O'REILLY: And insurance. And infrastructure. So send $10 bucks in? CROWLEY: I done yet. O'REILLY: But might? CROWLEY: I – I seriously considering it. However, -- here's why. Because lot times disasters happen third-world countries, everybody rushes desperately poor, say Haiti. But I also think disaster happens first world, countries better equipped rebuild richer, mean deserve support moral economic less. O'REILLY: All right. But there's matter deserving there's matter whether lot good. Look, disaster here, Colmes, United States, right, we're getting money anybody. CROWLEY: That's true. O'REILLY: Nobody sending us anything. ALAN COLMES, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Katrina people wanted help us; 9/11 people wanted help us.
