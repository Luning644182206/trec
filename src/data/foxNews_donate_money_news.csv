Students and faculty told Q13 Fox that they waited more than an hour to get the all-clear to head back inside the building.

Chip and Joanna Gaines on ending 'Fixer Upper'
HGTV stars open up about their relationship.




Chip Gaines said he was going to cut his hair off to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the “Fixer Upper” star has stayed true to his word and shaved his head entirely. 






His wife, Joanna Gaines, shared a photo on Facebook on Wednesday night of her HGTV star hubby’s newly shaved head.
She wrote, “We are leaving Memphis changed. Kiddos of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital we go with your faces on our minds and your stories in our hearts. Thank you for letting us be a part of your home at Target House. We are cheering you on every step of the way.”




Last week, Chip wrote on Instagram that he was asking his fans to donate money to St. Jude’s and he would cut – or even shave – his head depending on how much was raised.
“Next week, Jo and I are visiting the beautiful kids at Target House with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. No family ever pays @StJudefor treatment, travel or food — so basically, we want to bring them a giant check from YOU to help cover costs — lets come together to do something big to bless these kiddos.”
He explained, “the more money we raise over the next FOUR days, the shorter my hair goes.”

    It’s come to my attention that most of you hate my current hairstyle. But how MUCH do you hate it? Now’s the time to put your money where your mouth is. ⠀ ⠀ So here's the deal: Next week, Jo and I are visiting the beautiful kids at Target House with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. No family ever pays @StJude for treatment, travel or food—so basically, we want to bring them a giant check from YOU to help cover costs—lets come together to do something big to bless these kiddos. ⠀ ⠀ Donate to @StJude through the link in my profile, and the more money we raise over the next FOUR days, the shorter my hair goes. That's a promise. And, who knows, maybe if you really exceed my expectations...I'll buzz it all off. #OperationHaircut A post shared by Chip Gaines (@chipgaines) on Nov 2, 2017 at 11:57am PDT





Chip and Joanna Gaines recently announced the current season of their hit HGTV show would be the last. They have said they are taking a break from “Fixer Upper” to focus on other ventures.

""We saw communities banding together. Neighbors helping neighbors. Strangers helping strangers. So many heroes, people like Mattress Mack, who opened up his stores and showrooms for those who needed shelter. The group of people who formed a human chain to save a man from a flooded SUV. And J.J. Watt from the Houston Texans, who has raised over $18 million dollars to provide food, water, and supplies to the victims,” Fallon said.

""And I'm proud to say that our show, 'The Tonight Show,' is donating one million dollars to J.J.’s fund,"" Fallon said. ""Thank you, J.J.""

Trump border wall crowdfunding possible under Tennessee lawmaker's 'trust fund' bill,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/21/trump-border-wall-crowdfunding-possible-under-tennessee-lawmakers-trust-fund-bill.html,"

Trump's border wall by the numbers
President Donald Trump's border wall is constantly in the headlines. What are some of the facts and figures behind it?




Those who want to see President Trump’s border wall built may get a chance to help fund the project if a recently introduced bill is passed.






The legislation, introduced by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., last week, would create a “border wall trust fund.” People could donate any amount of money to it, with the funds specifically designated for “whatever it takes to build the wall” -- from supplies to salaries. It would be overseen by the Treasury Department, according to Black.
“Real immigration reform cannot be achieved without a secure border -- President Trump has been clear about this since day one,” Black, a member of the House Budget Committee, said in a statement. “The most important job of the federal government is the safety and security of the American people, and if citizens in our country wish to contribute to this effort, they absolutely should be given the opportunity.”

In an interview with Fox News, Black said while anyone can donate money to the U.S. Treasury now, this trust fund would ensure donations would specifically go toward the construction of the border wall.
“I support President Trump in building the wall. It’s going to take big funds to do that,” Black said, adding that she doesn’t believe Congress has done enough in terms of allocating funding for the wall.
 Border Wall Trust Fund Act by Kaitlyn on Scribd
Black stressed that the trust fund wouldn’t be the first time the government used crowdfunding to complete a project. She said the fund could be patterned after the private donations used to construct the Washington Monument.



Created in 1833, the Washington National Monument Society fundraised to begin construction of the Washington Monument. The society was given land, raised money and hired architect Robert Mills to design the memorial. However, the group ran out of money, and construction of the memorial was stalled for more than 20 years until Congress took it over, according to the National Park Service.
Corporations, including Target, also paved the way monetarily for restorations to the monument beginning in 1996, according to the National Park Service.
Black, who is running for governor in Tennessee, said she’s already heard from a number of her constituents who support the idea of a public trust fund. If established, Black said she and her husband would be first to donate.
In March, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that included only $1.6 billion for border measures -- much of which is for repairs to already existing fencing. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and the White House said the spending bill provided for 100 miles of border construction; however, it specifically ruled out any new prototypes for the wall such as the ones Trump visited in California earlier this year.
RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), blamed Democrats for the lack of border funding, including in the spending package. He told Fox News that Black’s bill “would provide a unique funding source for the president’s signature campaign promise.”  
Heather Douglass, a spokeswoman for Black, told Fox News, ""We’re hoping to see [the bill] go through to the president’s desk.""

JJ Watt fundraiser for Harvey victims raises over $18 million,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/03/jj-watt-fundraiser-for-harvey-victims-raises-over-18-million.html,"












                                    Aug. 9: J.J. Watt started a fundraiser for Harvey victims.

J.J. Watt, the star Houston Texans defensive end, has raised more than $18 million for Harvey victims since creating the fundraiser last weekend.






As donations earlier in the week poured in, Watt continued to raise the goal — which began at $200,000 one week ago — hit $20 million as of Sunday evening. 
In a tweet, Watt showed a warehouse full of packages he said would be delivered to those in need.

According to the fundraising page, hosted by crowdfunding site YouCaring, the millions of dollars raised for victims of Harvey as part of Watt's fundraiser have donated by more than 170,000 donors.
Watt said that he couldn't help but want to help in the recovery process.

                                    A good Samaritan picked up the tab for hungry firefighters at Denny's.

Sometimes it pays to be a hero.






A flock of firefighters who had been battling the raging California wildfires were eating at a Denny’s restaurant when another patron decided to show her appreciation.
“While eating, an anonymous woman told the Denny’s staff that she wanted to buy all of the firefighter’s meals,” the Colton Fire Department posted to Facebook.

With about 25 firefighters dining at the time, the steep bill came out to $405, including tip. The kind woman not only paid the bill, but also shelled out $100 to treat the crew to dessert.



The fire department’s spokesman Capt. Tom DeBellis said these acts of kindness are not uncommon in the small Californian community.
“It happens all the time,” DeBellis told the San Bernardino County Sun. “More so when we’re on big fires. People just anonymously donate money to cover the bill. They want to do what they can to help.”



The Colton Fire Department thanked the anonymous citizen for her “generous show of support.”
“We are all honored to serve the citizens of our communities,” the department wrote.

Here's what will really work",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/06/28/want-to-defeat-lazy-corrupt-and-out-touch-politicians-in-both-parties-heres-what-will-really-work.html,"

This year, millions of Americans have voted in congressional primaries and runoffs – including Tuesday’s contests in New York, Colorado, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah.






These voters, who comprised just 15 percent of the eligible electorate in the last midterm election season, are wasting their time.   
Thus far, 277 of the 280 incumbents running for re-election this year have won their primaries. And 121 of those incumbents ran unchallenged.

One might assume that incumbents are nearly invincible because they pay attention to their constituents. Even though 8 in 10 Americans are ""dissatisfied"" with Congress, we mostly love our own representatives. Or so the thinking goes.
But this narrative breaks down under scrutiny. In April, a Gallup poll found that only half of voters believed their representative deserved to be re-elected.
With such middling approval ratings, we'd expect dozens of incumbents to lose their seats each election cycle. Yet they don't – mostly thanks to generous support from super PACs, which spend millions of dollars to prop up incumbents and smear challengers. Incumbents return the favor by voting for legislation that benefits these mega-donors.



Super PACs, formally known as ""independent expenditure-only committees,"" became an electoral juggernaut after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision.
The Supreme Court ruled that corporations, political parties and individuals can donate unlimited funds to super PACs so long as those PACs remain ""independent"" – in other words, they can't coordinate directly with candidates or directly donate money. They can, however, spend tens of millions of dollars on advertisements and get-out-the-vote efforts.
The ruling has been a godsend for incumbents. During the most recent midterm election cycle, super PACs spent nearly twice as much money promoting incumbent House members as they did promoting challengers. This cycle, more than 92 percent of all PAC spending has gone to incumbents.
Unsurprisingly, most PAC money comes from corporations and ultra-wealthy donors. During the 2016 primary season, nearly half of the $600 million in super PAC donations came from fewer than 50 individual donors. So far this cycle, just 10 wealthy donors have given over $76 million to super PACS. That figure will skyrocket as the November elections draw closer.
Politicians are desperate to keep this money flowing. They no longer care what their constituents believe – they're completely beholden to their donors. In fact, the bottom 90 percent of American income earners have barely any influence over government decisions, according to a joint Northwestern-Princeton University study of about 2,000 public opinion surveys.
Many Americans support campaign finance reform to get big money out of politics. But with super PACs protected by the Citizens United ruling and Congress in no mood to turn off the cash spigot, the chances for meaningful reform look slim.
Party committees aren't helping either. Both sides discourage challengers from within, under the premise that competition disrupts party unity and wastes resources.
Handwringing and complaining about money in politics isn’t the answer. It's time for voters to fight fire with fire.
Small-dollar donors can't move the needle on their own. No politician will notice an individual contribution of $20, $50, or even $200. But in aggregate, these small-dollar donors are immensely influential.
Consider the 2016 presidential election. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign and various fundraising committees raised nearly $230 million and almost took down a heavily-favored Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. More than half of those funds came from donations under $200. The average donation? Less than $30.
Or look at Donald Trump's campaign, which raised more than $86 million from small-dollar donors. Those donations accounted for two-thirds of his total fundraising – a higher percentage than President Obama enjoyed in 2008 and 2012.
By banding together financially, small-dollar donors can sway federal elections. And they can do so via the preferred vehicle of big-dollar donors – super PACs.
Super PACs sound nefarious. But they're just legal entities for raising and spending political contributions. Anyone can set up a super PAC. If fed-up voters unite behind a handful of such organizations, they could defeat lazy, corrupt and out-of-touch incumbents in both parties.
The average incumbent member of the House has raised just over $1 million this election cycle. If just 5,000 constituents contributed $200 to a super PAC opposed to that incumbent's candidacy, they could neutralize that fundraising advantage.
Right now, super PACs are a tool for the wealthy and well-connected. They needn't be. With a modicum of organization, everyday voters could transform super PACs into the swamp's worst nightmare.

Kim Kardashian goes off on Kanye collaborator for saying he abandoned his mom's Chicago charity,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/27/kim-kardashian-goes-off-on-kanye-collaborator-for-saying-abandoned-his-moms-chicago-charity.html,"












                                    FILE PHOTO - Kim Kardashian and Kanye West arrive at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, U.S., August 28, 2016. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo - S1BEUETWGVAA
                                    
                                



Kim Kardashian got furious on Twitter while defending her husband, Kanye West, from allegations he abandoned a Chicago charity established in his late mother’s name.






The Twitter feud started when Kanye’s former collaborator, Rhymefest (real name Che Smith), accused him of no longer supporting Donda’s House, a charity which aims to help youth in Chicago. As People notes, Rhymefest responded to a diss track released by Drake by asking for his help funding the organization, which he’s run since Kanye put him in charge of it. He even evoked Kanye’s late mother in his plea for help.

I’m asking @Drake to help the part of Chicago Kanye has Abandoned! Please contact @DondasHouse— Rhymefest (@RHYMEFEST) May 26, 2018


The tweets quickly caught Kardashian-West’s attention, who went on a rant about Rhymefest that accused him of overleveraging his relationship to the rapper.

“U haven’t been right since u got kicked out of the studio in Hawaii wearing fake Yeezy’s @RHYMEFEST,” she wrote. “You’re over levergenging Kanye’s name & asked Kanye to donate money to u so stop w your fake community politics & lies. Truth is you haven’t been able to sustain the foundation.”

Truth is you haven’t been able to sustain the foundation— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 26, 2018


“I saw you at our studio a few weeks ago so why didn’t you bring this up then @RHYMEFEST ? You were trying to get Kanye to listen to your sub par beats.  You have the audacity to use Kanye’s mom name to try to shead a negative light on Kanye.”

I saw you at our studio a few weeks ago so why didn’t you bring this up then @RHYMEFEST ? You were trying to get Kanye to listen to your sub par beats.  You have the audacity to use Kanye’s mom name to try to shead a negative light on Kanye.— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 26, 2018


“You better believe I will make it my mission to take Donda’s House from you and let my children run it the way it should be run!” she concluded.

You better believe I will make it my mission to take Donda’s House from you and let my children run it the way it should be run! @RHYMEFEST— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 26, 2018





Shortly after Kardashian-West’s response, Rhymefest released a statement of his own on Twitter. In it, he claimed that he did not seek out Kanye, but was asked to come help him on his latest album. He further alleges that the couple had been disinterested in the goings on of Donda’s House for many years.
“How can you criticize an organization that you’ve never physically been to OR that you’ve never even talked to the Executive Director or any of the team,” he wrote. “And lastly, I actually knew and was mentored by Dr. Donda West personally, and have met with and spoke to hundreds of her students and mentees who not only support the work that we are doing in Chicago, but compel it.”

Hey @KimKardashian good to hear from you. Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/dWvwZfr1b5— Rhymefest (@RHYMEFEST) May 27, 2018


Shortly after, Donda’s House released a statement announcing that it was changing its name.
“Due to recent events that have occurred over the last 48 hours, we have decided to no longer use the name Donda’s House Inc. This has been an incredibly difficult decision but the social media quotes from Kim Kardashian West, as well as the expressed interest of her family running the organization, has brought us to this decision.”

Please read the attached final statement regarding the future of @DondasHouse, effective immediately: @kanyewest & @KimKardashian. pic.twitter.com/aNVWbJ1h49— Donda's House, Inc. (@DondasHouse) May 27, 2018


A previous statement noted that the recent bad press surrounding Kanye, such as his now-infamous TMZ interview as well as tweets he posted in support of Donald Trump, hurt the organization's reputation and standing in the community.
On Sunday, Kardashian West took to Twitter once again to shed light on the situation from her point of view.
“Kanye and Donda started  a charity called Loop Dreams. When Donda passed, they changed the name to Donda’s House. Kanye paid Rhymefest a salary to run it. After several years of lack of performance from the organization and Kanye going through personal financial issues, he could no longer fund salaries. Rhymefest asked to take it over and Kanye agreed with no financial strings attached,” she wrote in a series of tweets. “Kanye gave his 'friend' an opportunity to run an organization on his own. So now that Kanye is being publicly shamed for not being involved makes no sense and,  at this exact time, just seems very calculated. 
""I have and will always applaud any efforts to give back to the community. To fight for justice and to help uplift the youth. But I will never tolerate someone who was close to Kanye who attempts to use his late mother’s name to publicly shame him while pretending to do good.”
The “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star concluded saying, “I will always ride for my man!”

Hurricane Harvey: By the numbers
Making sense of numbers associated with the historic storm; Jonathan Hunt reports from Los Angeles




They might be convicted criminals, but when it came to the heartbreaking devastation left by Hurricane Harvey this summer, they became heroes of sorts.






Inmates in Texas’ criminal justice system wanted to help those impacted by the Category 4 hurricane, which caused $200 billion in damage in the state.
“They were requesting to donate money,” said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. “It’s just something they chose to do.”

Nearly 6,600 Texas prisoners have donated more than $53,000 of their commissary funds to the American Red Cross, Dallas News reported.
The inmates mostly donated money from their small allowances -- $95 every two weeks – that are used for purchasing paper, pencils, and personal hygiene items.
HOUSTON ASKS OILMAN TO HELP WITH HARD CHOICES AFTER HARVEY



Each inmate contributed $8, on average, while others were able to give hundreds of dollars.
In addition to monetary donations, inmates and officers have been working hard to repair five facilities that were damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
Nearly 7,000 inmates were evacuated from prisons and treatment centers across the state after the hurricane flooded huge swaths of the state. The storm also left hundreds of prison employees without homes.
“There were literally people who worked through the storm and didn’t have a home to go back to,” Texas Department of Criminal Justice executive director Bryan Collier told the Dallas News.
So the inmates and the employees worked together to rebuild damaged facilities.
“They had us take down sheetrock, and this whole floor was just like dark brown,” said inmate Trusty Adam Hernandez. “You couldn’t even see the floor.”
HURRICANE HARVEY CAUSED HOUSTON TO SINK
Terrell Prison employee Sharika Patterson, whose home was destroyed by the storm, said she’s trying to remain positive while she works on repairs.
“I’m working. I’ve got to move forward,” Patterson said. “I try to laugh to keep from crying.”
Officials from the state’s Department of Corrections do not yet know how much the damages will cost, but they have already spent $3 million on overtime wages.

Meet Siberia's Jesus: former traffic cop turned cult leader,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/04/meet-siberias-jesus-former-traffic-cop-turned-cult-leader.html,"






Vissarion, seen here in 2010, claimed he is the reincarnation of Jesus and lives in southern Siberia with his followers. 
								
									 (Reuters)



Thousands of Russians have flocked to southern Siberia to follow a man who claims to be Jesus Christ reincarnated.






Sergey Anatolyevitch Toro, 56, was once a traffic policeman and a Red Army soldier before the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is not that man anymore. Now, the man formally known as Sergey calls himself ""Vissarion,"" and says he's the founder of the Church of the Last Testament, The Guardian reported.





Vissarion, seen here in 2007, was a traffic policeman before finding the Church of the Last Testament in the early 1990’s.
						
							 (Reuters)



Vissarion, who normally dons a long white cloak and sports long hair and a beard, lives with his followers in Petropavlovka, or what he calls his “Siberian utopia,” The Guardian reported. Since the early 1990’s, Vissarion has been able to attract some 5,000 followers who live by strict rules. They are not allowed to drink, smoke or possess money.

The leader teaches his followers about the apocalypse, reincarnation and vegetarianism, the Mirror reported. Vissarion says his goal is to join every religion on the globe together.

The BBC’s Simon Reeve interviewed Vissarion and a teacher who lived in Petropavlovka as part of a documentary slated to air Thursday, the Mirror reported.  



The leader, who reportedly has two wives and six kids, teaches a “great flood is coming and he promises salvation and spiritual perfection to his followers,” the Mirror reported.
Newsweek reported Vissarion’s first wife left him after he wed a 19-year-old woman, who posed nude for his paintings.  
A teacher who lives in Minusinsk told Reeve: ""We have a school of noble maidens here. We’re preparing girls to become future wives, future brides for worthy men. She has to understand not to rise above the man, not to be proud of her independence but to be shy, inconspicuous and weak.""





Vissarion’s religion has about 5,000 followers. 
								
									 (Reuters)



Reeve called the revelation “scary stuff.”
“I genuinely felt like I should be calling social services. They’re teaching Vissarion’s ten-volume sequel to The Bible,"" Reeve said.

Reeve asked Vissarion about his critics' accusations that the leader is “brainwashing and embezzling” his followers. Vissarion said the accusations made him feel “sad.”
“Sad, what else can I feel? This is unavoidable. I’ll put down the basis that will change all humanity,” Vissarion said.
Reeve noted at the end of the interview Vissarion requested his followers “donate money and provide labor for his profit-making businesses.”

                                    Tyler Perry pledged $1 million to Hurricane Harvey victims and said a part of it would be going to Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church following this week’s criticism.

“Madea’s Family Reunion” director Tyler Perry donated $1 million to Hurricane Harvey victims with a share of it going to Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church.






Perry, 47, posted a video of his announcement Thursday pledging $250,000 of the $1 million to Osteen’s church. Osteen was heavily criticized this week after his church posted on Facebook that its doors would remain shut “due to the severe flooding” but a series of social media posts seemed to indicate that the church avoided flooding.





Joel Osteen was heavily criticized by some who said the pastor did not open his church to hurricane evacuees. 
						
							 (AP)



“I know that there’s been some controversy about Joel Osteen and him not opening the doors of the church,” Perry said.

“Joel and Victoria are amazing people — there’s no way that they would lock people out of the church or not let people seek shelter.”
JOEL OSTEEN ADDRESSES HARVEY OUTCRY, SAYS LAKEWOOD CHURCH IS ‘ALL ABOUT HELPING OTHER PEOPLE’ 
“There were some safety concerns, and I spoke to them on the phone, and it all made perfect sense to me,” Perry continued. “So, before you just run and judge someone real quick, you need to know the whole circumstances.”



On Tuesday, Osteen opened his 16,800-seat Lakewood Church in Houston to flooding evacuees. He said the decision to open the church resulted from pre-planned discussions.
""You know, we work with the city all the time,"" Osteen said about the lead-up to the storm. “At that time the city was asking us to use city shelters, Harris county shelters and then when they got filled up that’s when we said, 'Hey, you need more room, Lakewood would love to help out.'""

Besides donating to Osteen, Perry said he was also pledging $250,000 to Rudy Rasmus, Beyonce’s pastor.
Perry said he was considering other places to donate to but urged viewers: “Make sure you are giving to people that are getting the monies directly to the people that need it.”
Perry concluded, “If you want to give, I will challenge you to find someone who has boots on the ground and who can really be effective.""

Austin Disaster Relief (ADR) said their Hope Family Thrift Store was accepting donations for new socks, underwear, cleaning supplies, blankets, toiletries and pillows. The foundation said they have enough clothing to provide to the victims.
Donate cash



The Red Cross and Salvation Army have asked for donations as the groups provide water and shelters to the victims of the storm.
""Right now the best thing people can do is donate money,"" said Katrina Farmer, a director with the American Red Cross. ""This is going to be an expensive disaster.""

Donate Blood/Diapers
""Diapers are not provided by disaster relief agencies,"" the Texas Diaper Bank said on Facebook. The agency has asked people to donate diapers to families displaced by the storm.
The South Texas Blood and Tissue Center said they were desperate for blood donations ahead of the storm. The agency specifically asked for O negative and O positive blood. The center asked people in the area to donate.  
Save the Children
Individuals can support Save the Children’s response efforts around the storm by visiting www.SavetheChildren.org or by texting Hurricane to 20222 to donate $25 to the Harvey Children’s Relief Fund.
Support for the fund, the charity said, will ""help us protect vulnerable children and provide desperately needed relief to families.""

An Instagram post served as Paris Jackson's heartfelt birthday wishes to her pop legend father Michael Jackson, who would have turned 59 today.






Jackson, 19, posted a photo of her and the late pop singer when she was younger, sharing a kiss.
    birthday wishes to the love of my life, the one person who showed me what passion truly was, the one that gave me solid morals to live by and how to dream. i will never feel love again the way i did with you. you are always with me and i am always with you. though i am not you, and you are not me, i know with all of my being that we are one. and our souls will never change in that way. thank you for the magic, forever and always.

Jackson spoke out during the ceremony condemning the violence in Charlottesville, where white nationalists were protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a car drove into a crowd of people protesting the rally.
The teen defended herself on Twitter to users who said her father would not approve.
“If you constantly talking bout how much ya love an artist who made his whole message ‘peace n love,’ maybe dont obsessively spread hate,” Jackson said in a tweet.

                                    Wyatt Rees and his wife, Mindy, are pictured with the Clarks, who gave them an adaptive van after hearing about their story.

A young Idaho family grappling with their father’s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosis was recently given $10,000 from a “Secret Santa,” which they said will help pay for medical bills and other unexpected costs. Wyatt Rees, who was diagnosed with ALS before his 33rd birthday in August, is now confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk or talk on his own, PEOPLE reported.






Rees, who shares four children ages 7, 5, 2 and 4 months with his wife Mindy, worked as a teacher before his diagnosis. Mindy now cares for him fulltime and they are relying on their savings, while their family members and friends regularly pitch in to help out.
“They all know how to help him, so we make it like a family effort,” Mindy told PEOPLE. “I’ll do anything for the person that I love, and if that means I have to sacrifice, it’s not a sacrifice to me. I get to be with that person that I love, and take care of him.”

'MAN FLU' IS REAL? RESEARCHER SAYS MEN TAKE LONGER TO RECOVER FROM VIRUSES, COLDS
The $10,000 comes as a part of an unidentified donor’s goal to give away $200,000 to deserving residents in east Idaho. The person asked for EastIdahoNews.com’s help in identifying families, and in turn the news station had people to nominate others they felt deserved the money. An unidentified friend nominated the Rees family.



“It’s been a long struggle with a lot of uncertainty as the family has had to figure out what was happening and how to handle the new reality that Wyatt wasn’t going to get better,” the friend said, according to EastIdahoNews.com. “Mindy is a strong and happy person. She loves Wyatt and her family very much. They have four small children who could really use some extra care and love this Christmas. Mindy and Wyatt just celebrated their 11th anniversary and could also really use some happy times together.”



As the family’s story began circulating, others began stepping forward to ask how they could help. The family has since received an adaptive van that will help transport Rees to and from appointments.

“We are so thankful for the Secret Santa gift and the outpouring of love we have received from everyone over the past few days,” the family said in a statement. “We have been truly blessed. Wyatt’s job has supported him since his diagnosis and the doctors have been incredible. There are so many more people deserving of financial assistance this Christmas and we would encourage anyone who wishes to donate money to us to look for someone else in need. We hope to pay this kindness forward one day and wish everyone a Merry Christmas.”
The Rees family keeps supporters updated on the “Hope On The Horizon” Facebook page, as well as through a personal blog.

Bully victim Keaton Jones receives support, gift offers from celebs
Fox411: After video of Keaton Jones' tearful recounting of being bullied went viral, the Tennessee boy has received an outpouring of support and gift offers from celebrities and athletes like Chris Evans and UFC's Dana White.




A moving video that made a little boy famous is focusing scrutiny on his mom, she says unfairly.






Middle schooler Keaton Jones' video revealing his torment from being bullied at school went viral over the weekend. Celebrities including Chris Evans, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Gal Gadot took up his anti-bullying message, sharing the video with their huge social media followings.

Stay strong, Keaton. Don’t let them make you turn cold. I promise it gets better. While those punks at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be in this world, how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year? https://t.co/s1QwCQ3toi— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) December 10, 2017


Sometime during the massive outpouring of support -- the video has been viewed over 15 million times -- his mom, Kimberly Jones, set up a PayPal account where people could donate money, causing some to question her motives.

One public figure, Joe Schilling, a Bellator MMA fighter, who was touched by the young boy's heartbreaking story, reached out to Jones to invite Keaton to a show. He said he was surprised by Jones' reaction.
Schilling posted a video on Monday via Instagram with the caption, ""Go look at her ig watch her story posts she just running a money scam. Really really sad and disgusting. Tagging celebrities trying to get them to donate to her go fund me account smfh. @kimberlyjones_38 @danawhite @gracegraciefit @snoopdogg @plies.""
              
             
               
              
              
              



    
        Display nothing; This is on Publish with no configured Image
    
    
    




              
          
              Schilling said in his irate Instagram post, ""I feel pretty stupid right now. I was pretty moved by Keaton Jones video so I reached out to his mom and was going to bring him out to LA for a Bellator event that's coming up, big show, and and introduce him to fighters, be his friend, and she just wants money. She just wants me to share her GoFund me account.""



Schilling said he asked Kimberly Jones during their conversation what the GoFund me account was for to which he claimed she said, ""You know Christmas is coming and I'm a single mother, blah, blah, money's tight.""
The GoFundMe account in Keaton's name has over $58,000 in donations.
But Jones is fighting back against Schilling's claims, telling Fox News they are ""untrue.""
""I did not tell him that I would rather have donations instead of the help from celebrities,"" Jones said in an Instagram direct message.

Different is special. You’re beautiful Keaton. Inside and out. #IStandWithKeaton https://t.co/I7jTVF3izn— Gal Gadot (@GalGadot) December 11, 2017


Fox News reached out to Schilling but did not receive comment.
Jones is also under fire for some alleged posts on a personal Facebook page that has since been set to private. The mom of three is pictured posing with a Confederate flag in one snap, and another picture shows her son holding an American flag while another child holds the Confederate flag.
""I've taken that down for a reason,"" Jones told Fox News of her Facebook page, without revealing what that reason is.
Jones also took to her Instagram account on Monday to defend herself against claims she is using her son's story for money.
""I love my kids: Ya'll people do not know me or my family,"" Jones wrote. ""Did y'all know that my son Keaton was spit on in school, picked on by teachers, that supposed to be there for him??? I'm guessing y'all didn't because y'all wanna steady Judge me and say I'm using him for money that's false.""

No bill, no break: Dems stage House sit-in over gun control
House Democrats protest inaction on gun violence




The House Ethics Committee said Tuesday it had cleared the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee of wrongdoing tied to last year’s House floor sit-in over firearms.






The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) had argued New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who leads the campaign arm dedicated to getting Democrats elected to the House, broke House rules by asking people to donate money during the 26-hour sit-in.
But the Ethics Committee determined that Lujan didn’t use any government resources for campaign purposes or use the House floor as a campaign forum.

However, the Ethics Committee did find that a Lujan political operative used an image of the sit-in from the House floor for a campaign ad. The Ethics Committee declared the instance was an “inadvertent, technical violation” of House rules.
The House bars using official resources on the floor for campaign purposes.
“Members are ultimately responsible for actions taken in their name that they delegate to third parties,” the Ethics Committee said. “Thus, Members should take reasonable steps to ensure that their campaign committees or consultants comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.”



In June of last year, Democrats shut down the House's legislative work by staging a sit-in on the House floor and refusing to leave until they secured a vote on gun control measures before lawmakers' weeklong break.
More than 200 Democrats led by Georgia Rep. John Lewis demanded a vote on measures to expand background checks and block gun purchases by some suspected terrorists in the aftermath of the massacre in Orlando, Florida that killed 49 people in a gay nightclub.
HOUSE DEMOCRATS STAGE SIT-IN PROTEST IN DISPUTE OVER GUN CONTROL
FACT made the original complaint about Lujan to the outside, quasi-official “Office of Congressional Ethics,” or OCE. The OCE ultimately passed the complaint along to the formal Ethics Committee.
One of the issues in the complaint was whether Lujan sent out emails advocating campaign action on guns from the House floor. But the Ethics Committee could not determine if he was actually on the floor when the emails were sent.
Lujan’s office had called the complaint against the congressman “politically motivated.”
On Tuesday, the House Ethics Committee also said it dropped an ethics inquiry filed against Texas Republican Rep. Roger Williams.
The Ethics panel probed whether Williams, a car dealer, had a conflict of interest in offering an amendment two years ago to help the car dealer industry.
The Ethics Committee ruled the amendment did not present “an inference of improper conduct.” It said that Williams properly identified himself as an auto dealer when speaking about the amendment on the House floor.

COLUMBIA, S.C. –  U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has been accused of a violating a law limiting government employees' political activity by voicing support for a South Carolina congressional candidate.






In a letter sent Tuesday to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, accused the former South Carolina governor of violating the Hatch Act when she retweeted one of President Donald Trump's Twitter messages earlier this month supporting Republican Ralph Norman.
On June 19, the day before Norman faced off with Democrat Archie Parnell in South Carolina's 5th District, Trump sent several tweets praising the millionaire real estate developer as someone who would be a help to him in Congress and urging voters to ""#VoteRalphNorman tomorrow!""
Later that day, according to CREW, Haley retweeted the first message from her verified Twitter account, which lists her as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. At the time, the group said, Haley had at least 356,000 followers.
Haley deleted the message after journalists questioned it on Twitter. The group said Haley should still be investigated and disciplined. A Haley spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a text message.
Haley wouldn't be the first Trump administration official accused of sending tweets in violation of the Hatch Act, a 1939 law allowing government officials to personally donate money to political committees or engage in a variety of partisan activities, so long as they do so during their personal time and don't use government resources.



Earlier this month, White House social media director Dan Scavino was issued a warning for using an official-looking Twitter account to call for a Michigan congressman's defeat. CREW filed a complaint in that case also, and Scavino was warned if he engages in such activity in the future, the office will consider it a ""willful and knowing violation of the law.""
Other Cabinet officials campaigned in a special election to fill Georgia's 6th District seat, with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stumping for Republican Karen Handel earlier this month. An invite for that event reportedly didn't mention the title ""secretary"" instead calling the two Cabinet officials ""special guests.""
Earlier this year, Haley made a nominal donation of $100 to the GOP primary campaign of Norman, a former state lawmaker who was one of her chief legislative supporters when she served as governor.

"Dak, Dez, Cowboys raise Harvey money while others practice",http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/09/01/dak-dez-cowboys-raise-harvey-money-while-others-practice.html,"

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- With Dak Prescott on one end of a row and Dez Bryant near the other, the stars and starters for the Dallas Cowboys answered phones to take donations for Hurricane Harvey relief while lesser-known teammates practiced a few yards away.






The quarterback and his top receiver were among two dozen Dallas players on the sideline at empty 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium on Thursday night.
The closed practice on the field was the replacement for a preseason game that was first relocated from flood-ravaged Houston and ultimately canceled when the Texans got the OK to go home.

The telethon-practice combo was televised live by a local station. Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin was among the TV hosts, with the phone bank to his left behind him and the practice going on to his right.
Bryant took the call from owner and general manager Jerry Jones , who donated $1 million. Team officials said an early estimate on the total for the Salvation Army was more than $2 million.
""I think this is super cool,"" Bryant said. ""We're able to help one another. I hate that this situation had to happen, but the good thing about it is it brings unity. This is the perfect opportunity to show unity.""

Bryant, tight end Jason Witten and company wouldn't have been on the field anyway had the Texans and Cowboys played their preseason finale. While the second- and third-teamers worked out in full pads, most of the starters donned the sponsor-laded jerseys they often wear at community events.
NFL career rushing leader Emmitt Smith, a three-time Super Bowl winner along with Irvin and quarterback Troy Aikman in the 1990s, was among the former players who stepped in during the hour-and-a-half event.
The Cowboys were already planning a telethon when the game was canceled Wednesday, the same day the Texans returned to Houston after spending three days in the Dallas area and practicing twice following a preseason game in New Orleans.
""I think they did the best thing,"" receiver Cole Beasley said. ""Not just for us helping but for the guys, for the other team to get back home and get back to their families. The game is meaningless compared to what's going on down there.""
Under Jones, the Cowboys have had a longstanding partnership with the Salvation Army that is spotlighted during their Thanksgiving game each year.
The relationship got a boost last season when running back Ezekiel Elliott scored a touchdown and then jumped into one of the oversized red kettles that are on the sidelines starting with the Thanksgiving game. Now the Cowboys have raised money from that same field.
""A lot of people were calling in and it wasn't like, `Oh, Dallas Cowboys, cool, I get to talk to you,"" Beasley said. ""They were about their business and people really wanted to donate money.""
On the field, second- and third-teamers got their final chance to make an impression before the roster cut to 53 players Saturday. Rookie quarterback Cooper Rush was among them, although his preseason has been strong enough that he is likely to meet his goal of making the final cut.
Elliott didn't attend because he was at a hearing for his appeal of a six-game suspension over a domestic violence incident. The hearing covered three days, ending around midday Thursday.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday it will no longer allow prosecutors to strike settlement agreements with big companies directing them to make payouts to outside groups, ending an Obama-era practice that Republicans decried as a “slush fund” that padded the accounts of liberal interest groups.






In a memo sent to 94 U.S. attorneys' offices early Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would end the practice that allowed companies to meet settlement burdens by giving money to groups that were neither victims nor parties to the case.
Sessions said the money should, instead, go to the Treasury Department or victims.
“When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people—not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,” Sessions said in a statement.
Conservatives have long fought the policy introduced under the Obama administration. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would prohibit the Department of Justice from requiring defendants to donate money to outside groups, after concerns that the settlements bypass congressional appropriations processes.
“This bill is oversight and action. Congress must not tolerate Justice Department political appointees using settlements to funnel money to their liberal friends,” Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who introduced the bill, said in a statement. “This is also an institutional issue. Once direct victims have been compensated, deciding what to do with additional funds recovered from defendants becomes a policy question properly decided by elected representatives in Congress, not agency bureaucrats or prosecutors.” 



Paul Larkin, a senior legal research fellow at The Federalist Society, described the practice as “improper and unlawful.” He also said the practices were barred by the Appropriations Clause, Antideficiency Act, and the Miscellaneous Receipts Act. 
“No private lawyer could give away a client’s settlement money, and no government lawyer may do so either. It is time for this unlawful practice to end,” Larkin wrote in 2016. 

“No private lawyer could give away a client’s settlement money, and no government lawyer may do so either. It is time for this unlawful practice to end.”

Officials told Fox News the third-party settlement changes were an issue of ""good governance.""
“Unfortunately, in recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes requires or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement,” Sessions added. “With this directive, we are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct.”
Bank of America, for example, was required to pay nonprofit organizations as part of a record $17 billion settlement to resolve an investigation into its role in the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. The agreement was struck under then-Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department.
The receiving groups included organizations that provide housing counseling, foreclosure prevention and community redevelopment assistance.
Gibson Guitar Corp. also had to contribute to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to resolve a criminal investigation into allegations it illegally imported exotic wood.
It's hard to say what kind of cases could be impacted by the change and how. The new policy allows only for restitution to victims or payment that ""directly remedies the harm that is sought to be addressed.""
U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform President Lisa A. Rickard commended Sessions' decision for directing DOJ officials to ""seek justice"" in a manner ""consistent with public interest,"" adding: ""Not how much money they can generate for outside interest groups unconnected with the underlying enforcement action."" 
Chairman of House Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also applauded the move. 
""Since 2010, I've been working to shine a light on these misdeeds and to get answers from the Department,"" Grassley said. ""Today's announcement is welcomed news for those of us who respect the rule of law and demand a more accountable government.""

"'Smoking gun' email reveals Obama DOJ blocked conservative groups from settlement funds, GOP lawmaker says",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/25/smoking-gun-email-reveals-obama-doj-blocked-conservative-groups-from-settlement-funds-gop-lawmaker-says.html,"












                                    While Eric Holder was attorney general, the Justice Department allowed prosecutors to strike agreements compelling big companies to give money to outside groups not connected to their cases to meet settlement burdens.

The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claims he obtained a “smoking gun” email that proves the Obama Justice Department prevented settlement payouts from going to conservative-leaning organizations, even as liberal groups were awarded money and DOJ officials denied “picking and choosing” recipients.






“It is not every day in congressional investigations that we find a smoking gun,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. “Here, we have it.”
While Eric Holder was U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department allowed prosecutors to strike agreements compelling big companies to give money to outside groups not connected to their cases to meet settlement burdens. Republican lawmakers long have decried those payments as a “slush fund” that boosted liberal groups, and the Trump DOJ ended the practice earlier this year.

But internal Justice Department emails released Tuesday by Goodlatte indicated that not only were officials involved in determining what organizations would get the money, but also Justice Department officials may have intervened to make sure the settlements didn’t go to conservative groups.





“It is not every day in congressional investigations that we find a smoking gun,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. “Here, we have it.”

In one such email in July 2014, a senior Justice Department official expressed “concerns” about what groups would receive settlement money from Citigroup — saying they didn’t want money going to a group that does “conservative property-rights legal services.”
DOJ ENDS HOLDER-ERA ‘SLUSH FUND’ PAYOUTS TO OUTSIDE GROUPS



“Concerns include: a) not allowing Citi to pick a statewide intermediary like the Pacific Legal Foundation (does conservative property-rights legal services),” the official, whose name is redacted in the email, wrote under the title of “Acting Senior Counselor for Access to Justice.” 
The official added that “we are more likely to get the right result from a state bar association affiliated entity.”
The Pacific Legal Foundation responded to the email release Tuesday by telling Fox News it believes “permanent reforms to prevent such abuse are needed.”
“We are flattered that the previous administration would be concerned enough about our success vindicating individual liberty and property rights to prevent settlement funds from making their way to Pacific Legal Foundation,” PLF CEO Steven D. Anderson said in a statement. 





“When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people— not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.
								
									 (Associated Press)



Goodlatte, who is sponsoring the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, disclosed the emails during a speech on the House floor, taking aim at then-Associate Attorney General Tony West.
“Aiding their political allies was only the half of it,” Goodlatte said. “The evidence of the Obama DOJ’s abuse of power shows that Tony West’s team went out of its way to exclude conservative groups.”
The documents indicate West played an active role in helping certain organizations obtain settlement information.
“Can you explain to Tony the best way to allocate some money to an organization of our choosing?” Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Elizabeth Taylor wrote in one November 2013 email.
Groups who received funding also expressed appreciation for West’s efforts, according to the emails.
“Now that it has been more than 24 hours for us all to try and digest the Bank of America settlement, I would like to discuss ways we might want to recognize and show appreciation for the Department of Justice and specifically Associate Attorney General Tony West,” wrote Charles R. Dunlap, executive director of the Indiana Bar, in an August 2014 email.
Dunlap wrote that West “by all accounts was the one person most responsible” for the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts group receiving money.
One person, Bob LeClair, responded to Dunlap’s email by saying, “Frankly, I would be willing to have us build a statue [of West] and then we could bow down to this statue each day after we get our $200,000.”
West, who now works as an executive vice president at PepsiCo, did not immediately return an email from Fox News seeking comment.

Schweizer: DOJ settlements funnel money to left-wing groups


In 2015, however, Geoffrey Graber, who oversaw the Justice Department’s big banks settlements, told Goodlatte during a congressional hearing that the department “did not want to be in the business of picking and choosing which organizations may or may not receive any funding under the agreement.”
“But internal DOJ documents tell a different story,” Goodlatte said Tuesday. “They show that contrary to Graber’s sworn testimony, the donation provisions were structured to aid the Obama administration’s political friends and exclude conservative groups.”
Even before the release of Tuesday’s emails, Republicans had blasted these settlements as a “slush fund” for favored groups.
Gibson Guitars was forced to pay $50,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in 2012, though that organization has nothing to do with the case. In 2014, Bank of America gave money to the National Urban League, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America and the National Council of La Raza as part of a major mortgage fraud settlement stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.

'Aiding their political allies was only the half of it.'
- House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

Asked about the emails, the Justice Department on Tuesday referred Fox News to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ statement in June after he announced the end to the practice.
“When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people — not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,” Sessions said.
Goodlatte on Tuesday praised Sessions’ move to end mandatory donations, but called his legislation a “good governance measure,” and called it necessary to prevent a future Justice Department from reversing the action. The bill prohibits the Justice Department from requiring defendants to donate money to outside groups as part of a settlement with the federal government.
The Obama administration has been accused of unfairly targeting conservative organizations before — most famously after the revelation the IRS applied extra scrutiny to groups with “Tea Party” in their names.

Texas family jumped into action to help Harvey victims
Moran family is helping to coordinate rescues, gather supplies 




Seeing the destruction and suffering caused by Hurricane Harvey on TV – as survivors take their first steps on the long road to recovery – brings back my own memories of the aftermath of 55 deadly tornadoes that claimed 243 lives in Alabama on April 27, 2011.






Some things I learned after that terrible day six years ago can help us all understand what’s to come for the more than 1 million people displaced from their homes and for others whose lives were also upended by Harvey’s fury in Texas and nearby states.
I was not in Alabama when the killer tornadoes struck. I arrived in Birmingham the next day, moving there to start a new job as host of a radio talk show.

I was terrified by the devastation I found in my new community. So many people injured. So many dead. So many homes turned to rubble. Debris piles taller than me. Roads impassable.   
I submerged myself in working to help my radio audience – folks who needed healing, prayer and a listening ear. And with three postgraduate degrees in mental health, I got out of the radio studio as well, meeting more people than I can count to help them cope with their trauma. 
The lessons I learned in those terrible times have stayed with me. I want to share them.



Disaster survivors are leaders in helping each other recover. In the aftermath of the Alabama tornadoes, people helped each other survive.
I spent time with a nurse who had turned her home into a temporary medical emergency room. The home was a bloody mix of debris and wounded neighbors. The nurse’s son was injured by flying glass, but she stitched up his wounded back and he was helping her treat neighbors at a time when emergency medical crews couldn’t reach the area.  
I saw that scenario over and over in Alabama. And now the same thing is happening in Texas.
People opened their hearts and their wallets. The radio station where I worked set up a supply station in a parking lot near some of the worst storm devastation so we could relay needed items to those trapped in the rubble and to families trying to put their live back together.
Cars lined up for miles so people could make donations. Some came from other states. It was as if the whole world stopped to extend a helping hand and a warm heart. People wanted to give – in whole, pure, real ways – and they wanted nothing in return.
The same thing is happening in Texas, as we see millions of dollars in donations pouring in from  across our country.
Recovery is slow.  In Alabama it took weeks before the recovery of bodies was complete. It took months before some roads were even passable. And it took years for hearts to recover from the loss of life, memories and the security that comes with experiencing such devastation.
But here is what I remember most: Alabama came out stronger, better and united in ways you can only know if you have witnessed human compassion and need in such raw terms. The courage and character of the people pierced my soul and left me forever changed.
Texas will come out stronger and better in the months and years ahead as well.
Disasters can change lives in positive ways. As a mental health professional, I can tell you that research shows that horrors like those Alabama experienced in 2011 and Texas is experiencing now can ultimately change lives for the better. Character is built. Heroes are made. Priorities are defined. And human nature can be at its best. 
Studies show that hopefulness in communities that experience tragedy is often heightened – not depleted. People find new purpose and focus. They renew their lives in ways only achievable after tragedy.
Charity benefits those who give as well as those who receive. Studies show that people who give money and supplies to disaster survivors have tangible mental and physical health advantages, according to Elizabeth Dunn, a professor of psychology at University of British Columbia who studied the mental and physical health effects of those who give.
“Money doesn’t seem to buy quite as much happiness as many people assume,” Dunn reports. She cites one study where people were given money and asked to choose to spend it on others or on themselves. Altruism won out overall, and across the board. 
“People who donate money to charity are happier in poor and rich countries alike,” Dunn concluded. “You don’t have to have a lot to experience the emotional benefits of giving.”
Dunn found that people who give altruistically experience notably lower blood pressures, even when experiments were controlled for factors such as age, exercise and income. However, blood pressures did not show any change after people spent money on themselves.  
A big part of my heart will always be with the good people of Alabama. Still today, years after moving away to take another job, I can go there and people still hear my voice in a restaurant and ask, “are you Dr. Gina?”
Then they proceed to tell me how one lonely night, in the rapture of the tornadoes and in the days that followed they found hope in a friendly voice on the radio. They will never forget me and, rest assured, I can never forget them.
Devastation creates heroes who may not have ever had the opportunity to be heroes otherwise. It creates victory where people couldn’t find purpose before. It can create calm in the storms of life. And it can create memories that build the centerpiece for life – that of giving, and being cared for – in some ways, perhaps, our most human experience of all.

Congressman: Hearing on Clintons-Russia long overdue
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher tells Tucker he has been trying to get a hearing on the Clintons-Russia connection for months. #Tucker




Over the weekend, the mainstream media was absolutely giddy with delight upon learning there would be an indictment by special counsel, Robert Mueller.  






This was proof positive, they insisted, that Trump “colluded” with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.  Their exuberance was the equivalent of a two day-long tailgate party. Too bad it was premature. 
Manafort & Gates

The celebration came to a crashing end when the indictments of Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were unsealed Monday morning.  It turns out the charges are, basically, a tax fraud case.  The two men stand accused of hiding their income from their lobbying work for Ukraine in order to avoid paying taxes, then lying about it.  That’s it.
The 31-page indictment makes no mention of Trump or Russia or “collusion.”  The media seemed as dejected as a kid who wakes up on Christmas morning, only to find there are no presents under the tree.  Gee whiz.  
The truth is, it should have come as no surprise to anyone, much less the media, that Manafort was in legal jeopardy for his business dealings.  The FBI raided his home over the summer.  It was later learned that the FBI wiretapped his conversations as far back as 2014.  And it was widely reported that Manafort had been told by Mueller’s team that he would be criminally charged.

It could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.




The media became even more dispirited when they read through the indictment, discovering that nearly all of Manafort’s alleged wrongdoing substantially pre-dates his brief stint as chairman of the Trump campaign.  In other words, there is no connection to either Trump or his campaign. 
Somewhere, I’m sure, ABC’s Martha Raddatz and CNN’s Van Jones were crying.  Again.  Just like the tears they shed on camera election night when Hillary lost. 
Papadopoulos
But wait.  Shortly after the indictments were unsealed, the media’s spirits were suddenly boosted when the special counsel revealed that a former adviser to Trump pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian national during his time on the Trump campaign.  Surely this was evidence of illegal “collusion,” right?
Wrong.  George Papadopoulos pled guilty to a single charge of making a false statement to the FBI.  He was not charged with so-called “collusion” because no such crime exists in American statutory law, except in anti-trust matters.  It has no application to elections and political campaigns.
It is not a crime to talk to a Russian. Not that the media would ever understand that.  They have never managed to point to a single statute that makes “colluding” with a foreign government in a political campaign a crime, likely because it does not exist in the criminal codes.

To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law.  It is a legal impossibility.  He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.  

But that did not stop them from accusing Donald Trump, Jr., of illegally conspiring with the Russians when he met with a Russian lawyer to obtain information on Hillary Clinton.  What law did he break?  None.  The Federal Election Commission has made it clear that it is perfectly lawful for foreign nationals to be involved in campaigns, as long as they are not paid and do not donate money.  Which brings us to Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton
It is against the law for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to funnel millions of dollars to a British spy and to Russian sources in order to obtain the infamous and discredited Trump “dossier.”  The Federal Election Campaign Act (52 USC 30101) prohibits foreign nationals and governments from giving or receiving money in U.S. campaigns.  It also prohibits the filing of false or misleading campaign reports to hide the true purpose of the money (52 USC 30121).  This is what Clinton and the DNC appear to have done.
Most often the penalty for violating this law is a fine, but in egregious cases, like this one, criminal prosecutions have been sought and convictions obtained.  In this sense, it could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.
But that’s not all.  Damning new evidence appears to show that Clinton used her office as Secretary of State to confer benefits to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband.  Secret recordings, intercepted emails, financial records, and eyewitness accounts allegedly show that Russian nuclear officials enriched the Clintons at the very time Hillary presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia. 
If this proves to be a corrupt “pay-to-play” scheme, it would constitute a myriad of crimes, including bribery (18 USC 201-b), mail fraud (18 USC 1341), and wire fraud (18 USC 1343).  It might also qualify for racketeering charges (18 USC 1961-1968), if her foundation is determined to have been used as a criminal enterprise. 
Despite all the incriminating evidence, Clinton has managed to avoid being pursued by a special counsel.  Trump, on the other hand, is being chased by Robert Mueller and his team, notwithstanding a dearth of evidence. 
Robert Mueller
The indictments of Manafort and Gates now present a unique opportunity to challenge the authority of the special counsel. 
Until now, no one had legal “standing” to argue in court that the appointment of Mueller was illegal.  The criminal charges change all that.  The two defendants will be able to argue before a judge that Mueller’s appointment by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the special counsel law. 
As I pointed out in a column last May, the law (28 CFR 600) grants legal authority to appoint a special counsel to investigate crimes.  Only crimes.  He has limited jurisdiction.  Yet, in his order appointing Mueller as special counsel (Order No. 3915-2017), Rosenstein directed him to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.”   It fails to identify any specific crimes, likely because none are applicable. 
To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law.  It is a legal impossibility.  He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable. 
If the federal judge agrees, Mueller and his team would be disbanded by judicial order.  The Department of Justice would have to seek a new indictment of Manafort and Gates without the special counsel or drop the case entirely. 
The naming of Robert Mueller was tainted with disqualifying conflicts of interest from the beginning.  Fired FBI Director James Comey admitted he leaked presidential memos to the media for the sole purpose of triggering the appointment of a special counsel who just happens to be Comey’s longtime friend, ally and partner. 
It is no coincidence that Rosenstein appointed Mueller.  We now know both men were overseeing the corrupt Uranium One sale which involved Russian bribes, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering.  They appear to have kept it secret, even hiding it from Congress which would surely have cancelled the transaction involving a vital national security asset.  A cover-up?  It has the stench of one. 
How can Americans have confidence in the outcome of the Trump-Russia matter if the integrity and impartiality of Mueller and Rosenstein has been compromised by their suspected cover-up of the Clinton-Russia case?   Both men should resign. 
And a new special counsel should be appointed – this time to investigate Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump.

Jones, who led Moore by 10 points in a recent Fox News poll, said that now is the time to make a choice. Embattled Republican Moore spoke later at a ""Drain the Swamp"" rally in Midland City. He was bolstered by support from a wide array of local figures and prominent conservatives, including Steve Bannon and Sheriff David Clarke. Jones and Moore are vying for the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions' move to become attorney general earlier this year. Moore, has spent the last month of his campaign battling allegations of sexual misconduct with several underage girls when he was in his 30s, a charge he has repeatedly denied.

TIME TO BREAK THE CHAIN ON MIGRATION?: The attempted suicide bombing in New York Monday would never have happened if President Trump's immigration policies had been in place, the White House said, after it was revealed that the terror suspect had entered the country via chain migration ...  Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi national, allegedly detonated a pipe bomb in a subway corridor, New York Police Department officials said. Hours later, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to Fox News that Ullah was admitted to the U.S. after presenting a passport displaying an F43 family immigrant visa in 2011. That prompted White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to note that President Trump has railed against so-called ""chain migration,"" through which dozens of an immigrant's relatives can enter the U.S. simply because their family member made it. Trump, in a statement, blamed the attack on America's ""lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country.""

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE - INSIDE THE TRUMP DOSSIER: The man who says he acted as a ""go-between"" last year to inform Sen. John McCain about the controversial “dossier” containing salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump is speaking out, revealing how the ex-British spy who researched the document helped coordinate its release to the FBI, the media and Capitol Hill ...  “My mission was essentially to be a go-between and a messenger, to tell the senator and assistants that such a dossier existed,” Sir Andrew Wood told Fox News in an exclusive interview with senior executive producer Pamela K. Browne. Fox News spoke to Wood at the 2017 Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada. Just after the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, Sen. McCain spoke at the same security conference. Wood says he was instructed by former British spy Christopher Steele, who put together the dossier, to reach out to McCain. Wood insists that he's never read the dossier, which was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
SUSPICION SURROUNDS FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR'S POSTPONED TESTIMONY: Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was reportedly scheduled to testify behind closed doors in front of the House Intelligence Committee today, will instead meet next week due to a ""routine scheduling error,"" Department of Justice officials told Fox News ... McCabe’s testimony was likely to, at least in part, focus on Peter Strzok’s role in the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Strzok is a former deputy to the assistant director at the FBI who was removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's staff after Mueller learned Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump texts with a colleague. However, Fox News was told by those familiar with the matter that the intelligence committee is suspicious of the purported scheduling error. One source said they believe the schedule issue arose after Fox News' report Monday night on Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr, who was recently demoted from one of his two senior posts. Fox News reported that Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, worked through last fall for Fusion GPS, which was behind the anti-Trump dossier.
QUESTIONS SURROUND MOM OF BULLIED BOY: A moving video that made a bullied little boy famous is bringing increasing scrutiny on his mother and her motives ...  Middle schooler Keaton Jones' video revealing his torment went viral over the weekend. Celebrities including Chris Evans, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Gal Gadot took up his anti-bullying message, sharing the video with their huge social media followings. Sometime during the massive outpouring of support -- the video has been viewed over 15 million times -- Keaton's mom, Kimberly Jones, set up a PayPal account where people could donate money, causing some to question her motives.

South Korea's Park denies charges as corruption trial begins,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/23/south-koreas-park-denies-charges-as-corruption-trial-begins.html,"

SEOUL, South Korea –  Former President Park Geun-hye denied corruption charges Tuesday at the start of a criminal trial that could potentially send South Korea's first female leader to prison for life.






Police had earlier escorted Park, in handcuffs, into court for her first public appearance since she was jailed on March 31 for corruption allegations that led to her removal from office.
Cameras flashed as Park emerged from a bus, her inmate number 503 attached to her dark-colored jacket, and walked into the Seoul Central District Court. Her hands were then uncuffed, and she entered the courtroom and sat before a three-judge panel while a throng of journalists captured images, often in extreme close-up, of her somber face.
When Judge Kim Se-yun asked Park what her occupation was, she replied, ""I don't have any occupation.""
Her longtime confidante and alleged co-conspirator, Choi Soon-sil, sat near Park. The two women had been friends for four decades but did not acknowledge each other.
Choi sobbed as she answered questions about her address and occupation. Park stared straight ahead as prosecutors read out the charges.



""The accused Park Geun-hye, in collusion with her friend Choi Soon-sil, let Choi, who had no official position, intervene in state affairs ... and they abused power and pressured business companies to offer bribes, thus taking private gains,"" said senior prosecutor Lee Won-seok.
Both Park and her lawyer, Yoo Young-ha, denied all wrongdoing. Asked whether she had anything to add, Park said in a calm, measured voice, ""I will say afterward.""
Choi reportedly said in court, ""I am a sinner for forcing former President Park, who I have known and watched for 40 years, to appear in a courtroom."" She also said, ""I hope this trial truly frees former President Park of fault and lets her be remembered as a president who lived a life devoted to her country.""
Kim, the judge, said the court decided to combine Park's and Choi's cases, and set the next hearing for Thursday.
After the end of Tuesday's hearing, Park, again in handcuffs, didn't speak to reporters as police put her back on the bus to return to the detention center near Seoul where she is being held.
""I am here to witness a new chapter of history being unfurled,"" spectator Lee Jae-bong, 70, told a pool reporter. ""I think Park must be punished thoroughly and never be pardoned so that such a bad thing may never happen again.""
Park's arrest came weeks after she was removed from office in a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which upheld her December impeachment by lawmakers after massive street protests over the corruption allegations that emerged last October.
Prosecutors boast of having ""overflowing"" evidence proving Park's involvement in criminal activities. They say she colluded with Choi to take about $26 million in bribes from Samsung and was promised tens of millions of dollars more from Samsung and other large companies. Park also allegedly allowed her friend to manipulate state affairs from the shadows.
A spokesman from the presidential Blue House said the office had no official statement to make on Park's trial. New liberal President Moon Jae-in took office this month after winning a special election to replace Park.
The scandal has led to the indictments of dozens of people, including former Cabinet ministers, senior presidential aides and billionaire Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong, who is accused of bribing Park and Choi in exchange for business favors. Lee faces a separate trial.
Park has apologized for putting trust in Choi but denied breaking any laws and accuses her opponents of framing her. Choi also denies wrongdoing.
Park has spent the past weeks locked in a small cell with a television, toilet, sink, table and mattress. She reportedly sees only a few visitors and her lawyers, and mostly avoids television and newspapers. She avidly reads an English-Korean dictionary, according a report by a South Korean cable news channel that cited an unnamed detention center source.
Park enjoyed overwhelming support from conservatives who recalled her dictator father lifting the nation from poverty in the 1960-70s; critics recall his severe human rights abuses.
But she was accused of mishandling a 2014 ferry disaster that killed more than 300 people, mostly schoolchildren. And the scandal involving Choi destroyed Park's carefully crafted image as a selfless daughter of South Korea and inspired an angry public to push for her ouster and then elect Seoul's first liberal government in a decade.
Opinion surveys show a majority of South Koreans back the prosecution of Park, but she still has staunch supporters.
About 150 people gathered near the court Tuesday and reportedly waved national flags and raised placards that read, ""Park is innocent! Release her immediately!"" Some screamed and cried when a bus carrying Park passed by.
Park's trial is expected to take several months.
The most damning allegation is that Park and Choi took bribes from Samsung, the country's largest business group. Lee, Samsung's de facto chief, is under suspicion of using millions in corporate funds to sponsor companies, sports organizations and nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi.
In exchange, Park ensured government backing for a contentious merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 that was a key step in passing corporate control to Lee from his ailing father, prosecutors say.
Prosecutor Hwang Woong-jae said Park met Lee in July 2015 and that ""Park said she hoped the Samsung succession issue would be resolved smoothly under her government and asked Lee Jae-Yong to support the two foundations.""
Lee has denied using the payments to win support for the 2015 deal, saying Samsung was just responding to Park's requests to support culture and sports.
Park's lawyer, Yoo, said Park could not have benefited from the foundations because individuals could not freely take away money.
""There was no reason for President Park to force companies to donate money that she was unable to use for herself,"" Yoo said.

"It isn't TrumpCare, after all",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/04/it-isnt-trumpcare-after-all.html,"

On the roster: It isn’t TrumpCare, after all - Trumps blesses more politics in the pulpit - Gowdy warns Rice: Testify or face subpoena - I’ll Tell You What: Live bills and dead parrots - Looks like somebody’s got a case of the Mondays
IT ISN’T TRUMPCARE, AFTER ALL   If the House, as promised, passes a bill today that would make sweeping changes to the laws regulating the health insurance industry and benefit programs for the working poor what shall we call it?
This note had been going with “TrumpCare” since President Trump and his fellow Republicans rolled out the first draft two months ago. But as the measure has gone through its disruptive lifestyle, perhaps that doesn’t fit anymore.
Considering the fact that whatever measure would result after the Senate is through with it would be more generous with benefits and more restrictive to insurance companies, it might be better to think of this initiative as simply cuts to ObamaCare.
The reason ObamaCare is currently failing in so many parts of the country is that insurance companies are dropping out of the program. The initial design was that the government would enact onerous restrictions on insurers but then compensate them with new customers and new profits. That’s not what happened, at least in most places.



Because Democrats worried about the unpopularity of the law’s mandate that individuals purchase insurance, they kept fines low. The past year was the first time that the already seven-year-old law put much bite into the fines for non-compliance.
The toothless mandate meant that the young, healthy and highly profitable customers promised to insurance providers did not materialize in sufficient numbers.
While some 6.4 million Americans bought policies through the exchanges, many with subsidies from taxpayers, enrollees tended to be older and sicker than insurance actuaries would have liked.
The most expensive provisions for insurers in ObamaCare are those requiring them to write policies even for sick people and requiring them to charge the same rates for people regardless of their health.
New customers compelled by mandates or enticed by subsidies wouldn’t be enough to make up for all of that, so the law provided for direct subsidies to the insurance companies themselves. But, Republicans blocked those subsidies as part of a 2014 spending deal.
Without enough customers and with the promised bailout money gone, insurance companies have been leaving the ObamaCare marketplace in droves to focus on the more profitable, more predictable group market.
That’s a big problem, but not for most people. About 85 percent of Americans get their insurance either through work or a government program, and while premiums have been climbing there, the current crisis in ObamaCare doesn’t harm the vast majority of the country.
The real crisis is for the 7 percent or so of Americans who purchase their insurance on the individual market. Without larger risk pools to offset costlier customers and the aforementioned shortcomings of ObamaCare, more than 20 million insurance customers find themselves in a potentially perilous place with skyrocketing premiums and, in some places, no participating providers at all. 
The way the changes offered in the House today seek to address the problem is by lifting some of the restrictions on insurance companies. But, when faced with the harsh electoral reality of how Democrats would punish GOPers for rolling back coverage for the sickest customers, lawmakers opted to drop the final choice in the laps of the states.
Realizing, though, that a 30-second campaign ad won’t note any difference between voting to allow sick people to lose insurance and actually kicking them off, Republicans added billions more to the bill to cover pre-existing conditions through state-level high-risk pools.
But that’s not the biggest political bombshell in the legislation. That distinction belongs to a move to start clamping down on the ObamaCare expansion of Medicaid, previously a program for the indigent, to cover the working poor.
Initial estimates that 24 million people would lose coverage under the GOP plan stems largely from ending this provision, which allows adults who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line – $15,800 for an individual or $32,319 for a family of four. The legislation being voted on today drops that expansion, which is estimated to have extended coverage to 10 million people, in two years.
Shutting down subsidies and rolling back the welfare expansions in ObamaCare represents substantial cost savings to the already-expensive existing law. The proceeds of the cuts in this version of the bill are used to roll back taxes on top earners – nearly $900 million worth in the next decade.
So while we can say that the Republican plan definitely blows up core components of ObamaCare, particularly the end of the individual mandate, potentially some of the most significant restrictions on insurers and the coverage for the working poor – you could only just barely call it repeal. And you certainly couldn’t call it a replacement, since what it does is essentially provide less of the same thing.
It also seems unlikely that whatever comes out of the more-moderate Republican Senate would be more radical or transformational than this version. One imagines that if the Senate ever gets to the legislation, what comes back will look even more like former President Barack Obama’s original law.
For that reason, it isn’t really fitting anymore to call this “TrumpCare.” Republicans instead are trying to figure out how much they can cut ObamaCare in order to deliver the tax cuts they want.  
On the day after the 2016 election, it would have sounded a bit preposterous to say, but in the end, Obama’s legacy looks likely to remain intact.
THE RULEBOOK: SAFETY FIRST  “So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are less to be apprehended under one general government than under several lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of the people.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 3  TIME OUT: MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU In honor of Star Wars Day, we offer the Joshua Rothman’s, ahem, exploration of the historical context of a galaxy far, far away: “And, in other ways, ‘Star Wars’ is of a piece with everything that was happening in the seventies, with the search for greater meaning that was happening at a societal level. The Carlos Castaneda books were a huge influence: all that stuff about going back to basics, finding the magic in everything, becoming your better self, tapping into the power of crystals. All that hippie stuff was influential. ‘The Golden Bough’ was enjoying a huge revival in the seventies; everyone was reading it. There was a sense of, ‘Let’s pull everything down, let’s find the basis upon which we can all agree, let’s figure out that all religions point to this or that.’ If ‘Star Wars’ came out today, instead of then, I think it would still catch on, but it also caught the right wave at the right time.”

TRUMPS BLESSES MORE POLITICS IN THE PULPIT LA Times: “President Trump [signed today] an executive order aimed at protecting politically active churches from losing their tax-free status. The order, timed for Thursday's National Day of Prayer, does not include the broad religious liberty provisions leaked in February that could have allowed businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation and other moral objections. The new order contains a more vague blanket statement that declares the administration is committed ‘to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty.’ The order is also designed to allow religious groups to avoid a mandate to provide contraception coverage under President Obama's healthcare law … The most significant portion of the order would direct the Internal Revenue Service to ‘exercise maximum enforcement discretion’ in enforcing the Johnson amendment, which restricts religious groups from endorsing political candidates without risking their tax-exempt status.”
GOWDY WARNS RICE: TESTIFY OR FACE SUBPOENA Fox News: “Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) responded this morning to former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice declining an invitation to testify before Congress on the unmasking of Trump team members. … Gowdy said a subpoena may have to be used to bring Rice before Congress. ‘There are things called subpoenas. You shouldn't have to use it with a former national security adviser but if you do, you do’ said Gowdy, calling Rice a ‘very important witness.’ He said Rice may feel like she cannot testify in an open setting, so a closed-door hearing could be scheduled for Rice to give her account. Responding to FBI Director James Comey's testimony before the Senate [Wednesday], … ‘Someone was gonna criticize him no matter what he did. He did what he thought was right,’ said Gowdy, adding that Comey didn't tell Clinton to set up a private server or to give ‘disingenuous answers’ about it throughout the campaign.”

While the sprinkler head did indeed fall from the ceiling, it landed on her desk before White was caught on surveillance camera smashing herself in the face with it. White's employers filed a compensation claim, but the insurance company grew suspicious and launched an investigation. Footage from security cameras inside the office showed the sprinkler head falling onto White's desk. But instead of bouncing up, White could be seen picking up the metal hardware, and looking at it quizzically, before smashing it into her forehead seconds later.”

Rep. Black on leaving key budget post after fruitful year
Tennessee congresswoman running for governor in 2018 shares her perspective on 'The Story.'




This is a rush transcript from ""The Story,"" December 28, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.






TRISH REGAN, GUEST HOST: Thank you, good evening. It has been an entertaining year. Thank so much, Mike. ""The Story"" starts now. 
Breaking tonight, ""the DOJ and FBI need to be investigating themselves"", devastating words from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, just a short time ago in a strongly-worded letter obtained exclusively by Fox News. Slammed the agency at the heart of the Russia probe for a laundry list of offenses that are ""tampering Congress' ability to get the truth"" behind one of the most crucial components of the Russia collusion probe -- the anti-Trump dossier. 

Nunes, essentially writing that Congress can no longer trust the DOJ or the FBI and that the agencies continued to slow vote his committee's request for documents and interviews. This is just the latest in a series of blows to the credibility of Special Counsel Mueller's probe into the Russian collusion. So, where does this investigation go from here? In just a few moments, we're going to get that answer from House Judiciary Committee Member, Louie Gohmert, who joins me exclusively here on set in New York. But let's begin with Fox News White House Correspondent Kevin Cork, live in Washington with more on this bombshell development. Kevin. 
KEVIN CORK, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Trish, you're right about that. Listen, when we got this letter from Chairman Nunes, we all were like, this is big and it's such an important letter as it relates to the so-called Trump investigation, the Russia probe, and the Trump dossier. For the first time, we're actually seeing what the committee has been saying for quite some time, and what they've been demanding from both the DOJ and the FBI as it relates to the Trump, or if you will, the Steele dossier. 
As you showed there in that letter obtained exclusively by Fox News, Chairman Nunes of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, it scurries the FBI deal, for lack of a better description, stonewalling it and slow footing the information as it relates to those subpoenas. Which were issued, by the way, Trish, over four months ago concerning the dossier? Nunes, by the way, not the only Republican lawmaker right now who is incredibly frustrated by the stonewalling, if you will. And as someone put it to me today, the abject refusal on the part of the FBI and the DOJ to comply. 



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: The problem is in the swamp of Washington, D.C. The biggest alligator is the politicized FBI and Department of Justice, and that's why we're fighting hard to make sure that we've got a fair and equal opportunity for all sides to be heard. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CORK: But as you can well imagine, there are a lot of critics out there who were frankly saying that this -- talking about the House Select Committee -- this is politics run amok. Among them, you got it right there on your screen -- former FBI Director Jim Comey, who says, ""Sadly we're now at a point in our political life when anyone can be attacked for a partisan game."" By the way, Trish, I want to give credit where credit is due, our colleague John Roberts came up with that letter today that you saw there. 
A very important piece of work by my colleague, thank you and hats off to him. And I should also point out, there is more to the story. I want you to keep your eye on the calendar for January 3rd. That is the date in which the chairman, Nunes, has given both the FBI and the DOJ to come up with all of the documents that were related back to that subpoena, which we saw all the way back in August. Again, that's the third of January, clearly, that's the date we'll be keeping an eye on, Trish. 
REGAN: Wow! A fascinating development. Thank you so much to you and to John Roberts. Joining me right now: Mr. Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor. Good to see you, Professor Dershowitz, and good to have you on a night like tonight. 
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, LAW PROFESSOR AT HARVARD: Happy New Year to everybody. I hope that next year is a great one for everybody. 
(LAUGHS)
REGAN: Well, happy new year to you too. 
DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.
REGAN: The big concern here is that there may be people within the FBI that are slowing down this process, Chairman Nunes wants a lot of answers. There's a lot of questions about that largely discredited dossier, the Trump dossier, if you would, that may have actually been imparted to fed to us by the Russians themselves. Do you think these questions should be raised? And do you worry that politics is playing too big of a role there at the FBI? 
DERSHOWITZ: I do. I also worry that politics is playing too big a role in the Intelligence Committee. That's why from day one, I called for an independent, nonpartisan, 9/11-type of the commission of distinguished Americans who were above party politics to look into every aspect of Russia's attempt to influence our elections and other elections. That way we would've had transparency, we would have had the information coming out. Right now, the investigation of the special counsel is behind closed doors. We do not know what's happening. They decide what to leak, and what not to leak. It's the worst possible way of getting information in trying to cure a problem that affects both Democrats and Republicans and all Americans. 
REGAN: Yes. It's well put and well said. In other words, it does affect all of us. We do not want Russia intervening in our elections. And, you know, as we gather some of this out information, occasionally, it sorts of looks like they may have done more on the Clinton side. I mean, given that her team was originally commissioning this dossier. But that aside, I guess, you know, I just -- Robert Mueller -- many of them are calling for him to step down. You know, Chairman Nunes is concerned about the politics at play, as are you on both sides, do you think his credibility, Robert Mueller's credibility of him and his team has been compromised? 
DERSHOWITZ: I do, I think that it has been. I think he has not conducted the kind of investigation I expected from them because I knew him and he had an excellent reputation. He should've been more careful about staffing, you have to make sure that everybody who is investigating a president or a former presidential candidate is above reproach, (INAUDIBLE). You should have asked them about any tweets, the messages that they sent. Several of those people should never have been in on the investigation. I think that we have real problems of credibility, but those are all going to help Donald Trump because the pressure is now on Mueller to show the world that he can be fair. 
And the way that he can show that he'll be fair is to lean over backward and make sure he does not go after President Trump on phony obstruction of justice charges or emoluments charges. What he should be looking for is any hard evidence of real crimes outside of presidential authority. I don't think he's going to find it, but that's what he should be looking for. Because, otherwise, I think his credibility is damaged. Look, it's the hardest job in the world to investigate a sitting president or a candidate for president, and you just have to do it without making any mistakes. He's made too many mistakes. 
REGAN: Well, I'll tell you, you've been telling me from the very beginning here how concerned you were just that once you have the special prosecutor involved, they keep digging and digging -- and that's their job to dig and dig and dig, and they want to find something. Anything, right? Because, otherwise, they feel that they haven't got with what they're set out to do. 
DERSHOWITZ: And the American public says, why did we give you so much money for you to come back and say you found nothing? Look, they're going to find the low-hanging fruit -- they already indicted, you know, three people. I do not think the Michael Flynn indictment is going to get them very far because Michael Flynn was offering himself to rent or to buy. He was basically saying through his lawyer, look, if the president wants me on his side, he should pardon me. If the president doesn't pardon me, then I'll go on the other side and be a witness for Mueller. But he's already admitted that he lied to the FBI and I think his credibility --
REGAN: And to the vice president. 
DERSHOWITZ: -- and the vice president, but that's not a crime, but it is a crime to lie to the FBI. And his credibility has been destroyed. And any good defense attorney could rip him apart on the stand. He also saved his son from being prosecuted. And so, I don't think he's a very great value as a witness; he might be able to give them leads or tell them who else to see, or provide the documents. But as a witness on the stand, he's virtually worthless. 
REGAN: So, how do you sum this up right now? I mean, given that, so far, we do not have anything. So far, they haven't come up with anything that certainly hasn't gotten leaked anyway out there. Do they need to wrap it up soon for the good of the country? 
DERSHOWITZ: I would hope so. I think I hope they've decided -- and it would be very smart if they did not to look into obstruction of justice, not to look into emoluments, not to look into anything that's a function of the president doing his job, even if you disagree with the way he's done it. And to just look to see if there any real crimes, you have collusion, although the president denies there's any collusion. Even if they prove collusion, that's not a crime. Collusion is not criminally punishable, except if it's in a business context in violation of the anti-trust laws. So, at the moment, it doesn't seem like they have very much at all except, you know, a few indictments against the few people for the political equivalent of jaywalking that is failing to sign documents in the proper way, failing to disclose this away. It's not -- it's not getting anywhere.
REGAN: Well then, if that's the case, they're doing nothing but wasting a lot of our resources right now. 
DERSHOWITZ: I think that's right. 
REGAN: It is wonderful to see you tonight. And I hope you're getting a few more dinner invites or you know. Maybe you can make some friends with the conservatives there in town. 
DERSHOWITZ: Well, the liberals make better dinner parties. So, I'm losing several pounds now, which is making my wife very, very happy. 
(LAUGHTER)
REGAN: There's an upside to everything, right? 
DERSHOWITZ: I say what I say on principle. I've been saying the same thing for 50 years no matter who's the president. My real friends stand by me. My political opportunist friends condemn me. But I'm going to continue saying what I believe. 
REGAN: Well, Alan Dershowitz, we thank you for doing that. 
DERSHOWITZ: Thank you. 
REGAN: Thank you so much. All right. Here right now for more reaction: Texas Congressman, Louie Gohmert, Member of the House Judiciary Committee. It's good to see you again. 
REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS: Good to see you again, Trish, thank you. 
REGAN: Wow! So --
GOHMERT: And you've got to love Alan Dershowitz, he is consistent no matter what you agree or disagree. 
REGAN: You know, and we need that out there, because, you know, right now things have become so divided and so polarized, and so political. And all we want is the truth. 
GOHMERT: Exactly, that's what we're looking for. 
REGAN: And I know that you know, Devin Nunes is trying to pursue that, and the FBI doesn't want to give him what he needs. 
GOHMERT: Yes, one of the things that created problems with Jeff Sessions' recusal is in getting responses. Jeff has to, well, I recuse myself on that area, so I can't really get involved in the response. But I think he's going to have to lay down the law that looks, regardless of what the response is, get it to Congress now. 
REGAN: Do you think they're deliberately delaying? 
GOHMERT: I think the people that have these answers are, I absolutely do. Because, look at what's happened, for eight years, they have snubbed their noses at Congress, they haven't provided anything. I am still waiting eight years later to get the response from the Justice Department that I ask Eric Holder: give me the documents you gave to convicted terrorists in the discovery of the Holy Land Foundation trial. Now, to Jeff's credit, he's got people that are getting me the documents, but Holder is saying, well, there may be issues of confidentiality. I said you gave them to the terrorist, I think you can give them to members of Congress. Well, that's the kind of problem we've had for eight years. It's getting better, but we're not there yet. So, we have got to have answers. 
REGAN: Let me -- the big question and the big concerned is that the FBI might have used that dossier. 
GOHMERT: Exactly. Not only that, Trish, but also, don't forget they probably used the visit between, the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lobbyist that didn't have a valid visa, that Loretta Lynch had to specifically approve so she could come in and meet with Trump. He was totally set up. There was nothing to benefit, like they have promised, to help them with the campaign. And so, we realize, uh-oh, since they have been denied the warrant by the FISA court the first time, now they come and see Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with these questionable Russians that Lynch approved, of course. And then, you've got this dossier, this is too much. I think they used both, but we've to see, we need the answers to know. 
REGAN: Congressman, I'm amazed by that, because I got to tell you, you know, this thing was floating out there. The journalists have seen it, organizations have seen it, and nobody published it until, well, Buzzfeed, if you can call them a journalist organization decided to. Because they knew it was tainted, they knew it read like a piece of fiction, if I read the whole thing, and so any credible person would look at that and say, well, I've got to take this one with a grain of salt. Another FBI? And again, we don't know that they did that. What I think that --
GOHMERT: Well, we do know somethings that support it, though. Like, you have a member of the Justice Department that's meeting with Steele that did the Russian dossier. I mean, holy cow, how deep is this? It's -- this is much deeper than anything that they would've ever thought about. 
REGAN: I mean, so the Russians could've played us in this? I mean, they could've said, Christopher Steele, all of that information, which then caused our law enforcement to open this investigation. I mean, it is wild. And again, none of this is proven out, but I understand why you're asking me questions. 
GOHMERT: Well, it's really outrageous. We just never expected that the Justice Department would participate with a political party's campaign. We know that much is going on. They did work with Fusion GPS, and isn't that the truth? It was a fusion of the Russian information. False as it was with the Democratic Party, with the Justice Department. They did fuse all of the things together, so Fusion GPS's name is appropriate, but we've got to get answers. And I think at this time, even though he's recused on some of the stuff, he can still -- the A.G. can still come in and say, I don't care what the answers are, get them to Congress now. Get them out there now. I don't care if it embarrasses you, get them out there now, or you're out the door quicker than the messages are. 
REGAN: All right. Well, lots of interesting things to come, I would imagine. Good to see you.
GOHMERT: We need to get them. It's so good to see you, Trish. 
REGAN: Good to have you here in part. 
GOHMERT: Glad to be here.
REGAN: Happy New Year! 
GOHMERT: Happy New Year! 
REGAN: Still to come, everyone, shocking new statistics about the number of illegal immigrants who came into the U.S. during President Obama's last year in office. And it could help bolster President Trump's argument to get something done. Plus, one major Democratic voice is calling out his own party, saying it's time for new blood, first-generation, young generation as leaders. Ed Henry is here with that surprising story next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
HOWARD DEAN, FORMER DNC CHAIR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think my generation is going to get the hell out of politics, start coaching and start moving up this next generation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
REGAN: Developing tonight, as we approach the one-year mark for the Trump presidency, the Democratic Party is still trying to determine its future, its vision, its leaders, and its face. And in a surprise move, today, former DNC chair and one-time Presidential Candidate, Howard Dean, said it's time for a new generation to take over. Watch him here. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DEAN: I'm very much for somebody who's younger. I think my generation is going to get the hell out of politics, start coaching and start moving up this next generation. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, that means no Bernie Sanders, no Joe Biden, for example? 
DEAN: They may well run. I'm going to be supporting somebody who's younger in the next generation. I don't know who is yet. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REGAN: Fox News Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry is live in Washington with the story tonight. Ed, this is interesting for him to say that. And I guess the big question is: who have they got? 
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Trish, it's a good question, because even if Nancy Pelosi would step down, as the House Minority Leader, it's not like the people waiting in the wings for congressional leadership or the likely Democratic presidential contenders are fresh faces. Take a look, Pelosi and her number three in the Democratic Leadership, Congressman James Clyburn, both 77 years old. Her secondary command, Stenny Hoyer, he's 78. That led Democrat, Linda Sanchez, to declare earlier this month: all three should step down, not just Nancy Pelosi. 
More important than their ages, is the fact that several fellow Democrats have been going after Pelosi for her lack of fresh ideas. Expressing anger, for example, on her for initially calling Democrat John Conyers an icon and voicing doubt about the sexual harassment accusers before he eventually had to step down himself. A moderate Democrat from Ohio who challenge Pelosi and lost, Tim Ryan, said that in his home district, Pelosi is actually less popular than President Trump, and that toxicity makes it hard for Democrats to win top races in swing districts where all the Republicans have to do is run T.V. ads tying the Democratic candidate to Pelosi. Watch. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
REP. SETH MOULTON, D-MASS.: I've been calling for leaders to step down and to allow a new generation of leaders to step up and lead our party forward for a long time. 
REP. LINDA SANCHEZ, D-CALIF.: I think that we have this breadth and depth of talent within our caucus, and I do think it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders. 
REP. KATHLEEN RICE, D-N.Y.: Nancy Pelosi was a great speaker, she is a great leader, but her time has come and gone. 
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I respect any opinion that my members have, but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them. I think I'm worth the trouble, quite frankly.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HENRY: So, Pelosi wants to hang on. And some Democrats talking about her in the past, but here's the thing: some of the Democratic presidential contenders who inspire the most passion on the left have been around about as long as her. Former Vice President Biden, 75; Senator Bernie Sanders, 76; Senator Elizabeth Warren is a relative newcomer at 69-years-old. Howard dean explicitly said that is why he will not be endorsing any of those folks highlighting younger faces like Senator Kamala Harris, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Howard Dean predicting that like the GOP side the last time, Trish, there are likely to be about 17 Democratic candidates for president, if nothing else that's going to make the media very, very happy. 
REGAN: That is for sure. Ed, thank you. It's good to see you again. I know I'm going to get to see even more of you tonight. 11:00 p.m., when you fill in for Shannon Bream, we'll be watching. 
HENRY: I want you to stay awake.
(LAUGHTER) 
REGAN: I'll be there. All right. Thanks so much, Ed. Here with more right now: Brad Blakeman, he served as Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush; and Capri Cafaro, the former Democratic Ohio State Senate Minority leader. Good to see you both. You know, Capri, you and I have been talking about this for a while. But it looks like, some sort of main players like Howard Dean are waking up to it as well, the Democratic Party needs new blood. 
CAPRI CAFARO, FORMER DEMOCRATIC OHIO STATE SENATE MINORITY LEADER: It is way, way overdue, Trish, there's no question about that. And I think that you know, others in the party need to listen to Howard Dean. I mean, here's a man who actually led the Democratic Party to victory in, you know, almost a decade ago now. And so, I think that he is absolutely right on, and I'm sure that it does not surprise anyone. Tim Ryan, who you played a clip of, who challenged Nancy Pelosi, he's my member of Congress, and he's absolutely right that while certainly, we all have respect for the work that leader Pelosi has done over her tenure, she is more unpopular than President Trump amongst Democrats in many places. You know, including in our home community in Northeastern Ohio, so I think we need to see not only younger people coming into the ranks in the Democratic Party but a diversity and where the folks come from. Because the middle of the country and our voice is being stomped out by the voices of the coast. 
REGAN: You know, you get Nancy Pelosi, a very wealthy woman from California who represents what I think, you know, many Democrats are fearful, the party has sort of morphed into. You know, I grew up in an Irish Catholic family, and my dad grew up in a very big Irish Catholic family, and for them, you know, you are a Democrat like you were Irish and like you were Catholic, and it was very working class. And there was a sense that you needed to do more to help the middle-class. And look, this whole last election cycle, Brad, when you look at how Hillary Clinton, you know, refused to go and talk to, you know, minors in Pennsylvania, that had a big effect on people. And it seems as though increasingly with the Nancy Pelosi's and Hillary Clintons of the world, the Democratic Party has become a kind of, sort of, let them eat cake and they forgotten about the very people that they used to serve. 
BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: It is a sense of entitlement, it is an intrenchment. But to give Capri a little break, I will say that the challenge is not only for Democrats, it's for Republicans as well. We have to have opportunities in both parties for the younger generations to come up and have the opportunity to serve. I believe that service in an elected capacity should be an opportunity, not a career. There should be serviced, and then you need to go home. Our founders did that. 
Our founders were a diverse group of people who were lawyers, and doctors, scientists, and they serve their government, and then they left for their professions. And I think that's the big problem for both Republicans and Democrats. It's up to the people to determine the term, but what I'm saying is the party can have their own internal term limits. The problem is these candidates raise money. And how do you go to a guy who's got $5 million in the bank, and say, you what your time is up? He'll tell you to take a hike, primarily. 
REGAN: Go ahead, Capri. 
CAFARO: Well, I mean, that's a whole separate problem, frankly. I mean, you have members of Congress that are running on two-year cycles that are doing nothing but raising money in order to just keep their job. I mean, people need to be more focused on the actual job of legislating, but the way that the structure of campaigning is and campaign finance, they have no choice but almost to make fund-raising their full-time job. 
REGAN: No, and we did a lot on this last night -- just how much money is pouring in on both sides. And so, this is a frustration people have with Washington. So, this may get back to, sort of, the new fresh young blood that's coming in that isn't beholden to all of the special interest, Brad. 
BLAKEMAN: There's no doubt about the outside money has become a pollution to the electoral process. I wrote an article a couple of years ago for Fox News.com about campaign finance reform, and I suggested that you should only donate money to a candidate that you can vote for, so it follows your vote. That would take so much of the outside money out. 
REGAN: That's a good idea. We're going to dig that one out. Hey, it's good to see you, guys. Thank you so much, Brad and Capri.
BLAKEMAN: Absolutely. 
CAFARO: Thank you.
REGAN: Still to come, everyone, President Trump's strongly worded response tonight to these pictures, showing Chinese ships secretly delivering oil to North Korea. And a shocking new report on illegal immigration in the United States. The record number that entered our country and President Obama's last year in office is positively astounding. We're going to break it down with David Wohl and Richard Fowler right after this.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resource.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
REGAN: That was then candidate Trump at the Republican national convention pushing a cornerstone issue of his presidential campaign. And tonight, new immigration data could play a prominent role in the debate over a system overhaul. William La Jeunesse has that story for us tonight. 
WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Trish, those numbers are important because they will help shape the debate in Washington as Democrats push to legalize dreamers, and the administration hopes to end chain migration which has been U.S. policy for the last 50 years. So, according to a new analysis of census numbers the U.S. has seeing a surge of new immigrants, 1.8 million likely for 2016, highest in U.S. history, and 53 percent higher than just five years ago. By contrast, President Obama's last year saw more guest workers and foreign students, virtually no interior or work site enforcement, and no deportation for a visa over states, plus a surge in Central American women and children. Also, for the first time, President Obama allowed spouses of visa holders to work that encouraging more relatives to join green card holders already here in the U.S. 
Now, this graph shows where immigrants are coming from, compared to 2005 to 2015, Mexican immigration is cut in half from 400 to under 200,000. Central Americans are up 100,000, Asian immigrants and immigrations from the Middle East double, from Europe it's about flat. Family immigration is a huge multiplier effect, 70 percent of all immigrants according to the White House in the last decade have entered through family-based visas, and we're seeing the effects of it today. But no one is asking how many immigrants can the schools absorb? How many can the infrastructure support? What level is optimum to assimilate? No one is looking at the big picture. That's something you'd hope congress would address in the New Year. Trish, back to you. 
REGAN: Thank you so much, William. Here now with more, David Wohl, he's an attorney and conservative commentator, and Richard Fowler, he's a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and Fox News contributor. So good to have you guys here. David, I'm starting with you.
DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY: Hey, Trish.
REGAN: You know, it just seems kind of obvious. I'm all for people coming here that want to work hard, that want to contribute, that want to be American and be an American. I mean, this is a basic part of immigration, you would think, and yet we've got lottery systems and chain migration, and I don't know if we're putting our best interest first, am I right? 
WOHL: Yeah. I mean, it's quite incredible when you think about it, Trish. How about we get a say in who comes into our country, who legally immigrates to our country, and what we do with illegal immigrants? The good news with Mr. Trump, by the way, as we just found out today that the apprehensions of the worst of the worst, the MS-13 gang members, and other violent game members is up 83 percent over the last year. So those are the people Mr. Trump said he was focusing on, and that's precisely what he's doing, the apprehension, the prosecuting and the deportation. Now DACA is coming up, we all know that in the next three to six months. Democrats desperately want legal status dropped to 800,000 of these immigrants who came here as children, but in exchange for that, Mr. Trump is going to get a big deal, he's going to get funding for the wall, he's going to get an end to chain migration, as you said. He's going to get merit-based migration, which means that the best, and the smartest, and the most educated people come to America first. And by the way, there are plenty of those people from all over the world.
REGAN: Absolutely.
WOHL: So Trump has got it going on. He knows what he wants to do and he's going to get it done. 
REGAN: Richard? 
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's hard to say what's going to be in this deal. I think it is very true that we will see DACA get done in the New Year, and I think that's because Democrats have pushed for it. And the reason we're having this debate is because the president ended DACA irresponsibly, and so now we're having this conversation. I don't know if we'll end chain migration? And let's remember who chain migration benefited? Remember, the Trump family came here under chain migration, so did Melania's family because they've came also on the chain migration. So, chain migration is a program that has allowed for this country to thrive, right? Because we are a nation of laws and we can all agree on that. But as you said at the beginning of the segment, Trish, we're also a nation of immigrants, and that's what makes America great. It's because they've all come here with their culture, with their idea, and they're allowed to create -- open up businesses, create companies, and be part of the American dream. 
(CROSSTALK)
REGAN: I hear you. But, you know -- by the way, we're in a different place than we were 100 years ago or even 60 years ago for that matter. 
WOHL: We've got people that are coming here specifically to kill us, and that's a big problem. We can no longer say, well, you can bring your aunt, your uncle, your cousins and your kids over because they're related to you, we just can't do that anymore. The world has been under siege with violent terrorists from the Middle East. And that's why, by the way, Mr. Trump's extreme vetting is taking place, that's why the travel ban has taken place in certain places, because he's the first guy that had said from the White House that, you know -- political correctness is no longer going to be my guiding tool. I'm going to do what's right for America. We are going to be safe, and I will do whatever it takes, and those are three of the tools he's going to use. 
FOWLER: A couple of points on that. Point number one, Barack Obama in his last year as president supporting more people than Donald Trump did in his first year as president, number one. Number two, this idea that of painting all immigrants as trying to kill us I think is absurd. For you to come into this country. 
WOHL: I didn't say all. I didn't say all, I said a lot. 
FOWLER: Well, a lot I think is absurd, right? For you to come to this country.
WOHL: Will you tell that to the people in San Bernardino?
FOWLER: You are pointing to one or two or three different cases, 99.9 percent of the individual that come to this country they work really hard. Most of them work one, two, three, four, five jobs to make ends meet for their family, and all they want to do is pursue the American dream. And this idea that you say a lot paints all of these immigrants with a broad brush and that's wrong. 
REGAN: I think what we're talking about here, Richard, is reforming the system so that those people who are working 3 or 4 jobs and wants to embrace everything that's great about this country so that they can come here, because sure we do need them and we want them, we don't want to turn people away that want to embrace and help all of us. But maybe. 
(CROSSTALK)
WOHL: Richard is correct in that issue. And by the way, Democrats who said that Mr. Trump would send ICE out to individual homes and raid them and deport people in mass, obviously, he's not doing that because he has deported less people, 50,000 or so. Barack Obama.
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: But you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say that, oh, President Trump is way better on border security, he's way better on immigration, when President Obama was actually better on border security and better on immigration than President Trump is.
(CROSSTALK) WOHL: He caught people and released them. 
FOWLER: He deported more people than Donald Trump did. 
REGAN: You know what, that doesn't even matter at this point. What matter is that we fix this for the future so that we do not have people coming here that can't take care of themselves, can't support themselves, that becomes a drain in the system, and we don't want people that want to try to kill us. 
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: And once again, Republicans sent it away. There was an immigration reform on the floor four years ago and Republicans blocked it.
WOHL: And it's going to get past now.
(CROSSTALK) 
REGAN: Good to see you both, Happy New Year. 
WOHL: Happy New Year to both of you. 
REGAN: fingers cross, good things to come in 2018. Coming up everyone, a big announcement on Capitol Hill, the powerful Republican who says her work is done. She's going to be here for an exclusive interview. But first, two bombings in two days, and terror is being blamed for both. Is this just the beginning of another surge of ISIS? Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz is here with his take, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
REGAN: New tonight, terror being blamed for two attacks in two days, leaving more than three dozen dead, sparking new fears of a new rise in ISIS overseas. Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot has the story for us.
GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The word from Russian President Putin today is that blast at a supermarket in St. Petersburg yesterday was terrorism. An IED was planted in the store, it left 13 people injured. Officials say the device contained 7 ounces of explosives and enough shrapnel to really create some damage. No one had claimed responsibility, but at an event today Putin described it as a terror attack and that another was thwarted recently in that city. Apparently, a reference to a tip from the CIA about a possible string of planned bombings. Now there had been a few other bombings and attacks in that city. And Putin went on to say today, if security agents met any more resistance, the terror suspects should be, quote, liquidated on the spot. Seven suspects were arrested in connection with the thwarted plot, they were said to have links with ISIS. 
Meanwhile, over in Afghanistan, that country's ISIS offshoot, it was claim responsibility for a horrific bombing today, a packed Shite Muslim cultural center was a target, suicide bombers walked right into the center. They had a gathering there. They have enough seen death and destruction through other explosions around the outside of the building. The latest figures we're getting is 41 killed, 84 wounded, that include students, women and children. Now, Shite's targets have increasingly been hit by the Sunni extremists, ISIS in Afghanistan, it was started in something like 2015, it has been growing in strength as ISIS has been fading in other places like Iraq and Syria. Back in Afghanistan between ISIS and Taliban, that remains a very dangerous place. Trish? 
REGAN: Greg, thank you very much. Now here with more, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, he's a former green beret commander and is a Fox News contributor. Very good to see you, colonel. Wow, we were just talking about how there's been such an improvement in the fight against ISIS, and they have far less territory, but they almost don't need territory, right? I mean, because they can do so much damage in these lone wolf style attacks. Do we work with Putin, can we work with Putin on this as we tried to deal with this serious issue? 
MICHAEL WALTZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Trish, you know, President Trump is absolutely correct and that ISIS is defeated as a state, and as an Islamic state, but it's not defeated as a movement. And certainly, Islamic extremism is not defeated as a movement. You know, frankly, I'm surprised that Russia hasn't been on the receiving end of more of these attacks given that it sided with the Assad regime in Syria, and its airplanes have literally bombed and strait the Sunni opposition for years now. So, I think given that Putin just signed a major agreement with the Assad regime, which is aligned with Iran to expand its presence long term and permanently in Syria. I think that we're going to see more of these attacks. You know, in Afghanistan, 20 of the 40 of the world's recognized terrorist groups exists in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. And this is why President Trump's decision was so bold and so critical to stay engaged there. Look, either we're going to fight it and fight this war in places like Kabul or Kandahar, or we're going to fight it in Kansas City. And Trish, if I could just mentioned a number of these groups, the terrorist groups and the number of rogue regimes both Iran, North Korea, Syria are using American citizens as hostages and as bargaining chips against the United States. And tonight, as we speak, they're being tortured, they're being held, they have to be front and center in our strategies whether we're dealing with rogue regimes or we're dealing with these terrorist groups to get these Americans home. 
REGAN: You brought up North Korea, and that's increasingly a problem for us. Well, we have new pictures that suggest China is selling oil to North Korea, and this is something the president was not too happy about, especially considering that he had been trying to talk to President Xi and had him at Mar-a-Lago, et cetera. Let me share with you the tweet that he put out today. Frankly saying that they got caught red-handed, very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korean problem if this continues to happen. So, China, colonel, tells us that they're all on board for the sanctions, and then they go sell oil to North Korea? So, how are we going to trust anything China say in this whole dialogue? 
WALTZ: Trish, for decades now, literally, decades, China has agreed publicly that North Korea must be denuclearized. They just agreed to a another round of U.N. sanctions, which Nikki Haley deserves credit for getting both the Chinese and Russians on board. But, the proof is in the pudding with enforcement, the Chinese on the one hand just really released custom numbers saying that they cut off oil and gas. That they cut off food stuffs to the North Korean regime, but yet we have this evidence of black-market and other nefarious dealings. So the Chinese have it on their shoulders to peacefully stop this program before it becomes a menace to the world. And I think the president is right in not rolling the dice that Kim Jong-un is a rational actor, and not rolling the dice on an American city and saying, China, you take care of this program or we will. 
REGAN: OK. So, we want him out of there. We do now want a Kim Jong-un run -- nuclearize the regime. 
WALTZ: To be clear, the policy is not regime change. The policy is Kim Jong-un -- China, you can have your puppet governments, you can have your surrogate, but we're not going to allow his finger on a nuclear-capable ICBM capable of taking out an American city. And it's worth pointing out that our ground-based missile defense in California and in Alaska is only about 50 percent effective. I'm not willing to take that bet once a North Korean ICBM is in the air. 
REGAN: I've got to leave it there. But I will only point out there are a lot of economic options here. In other words, we can get tough with China and it doesn't have to be using the military. We can actually say, you know what, we're not going allow this trade, we're not going to allow our corporations to be over there and, by the way, get all their technology stolen. 
WALTZ: That's right. And the secondary sanctions against the Chinese entities doing business are critical. We have to do everything before a military option is on the table. 
REGAN: Absolutely, we need to move a few dollars and not any lives here.
WALTZ: That's right.
REGAN: Thank you so much. Good to see you.
WALTZ: All right, thank you.
REGAN: Fresh from a major legislative victory for the White House, one powerful Republican says her work is done. Tennessee congresswoman Diane Black is here to get a big announcement for you. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It included the repeal of the individual (INAUDIBLE) which is a disaster. That's (INAUDIBLE) half the privilege of paying a lot of money so that you don't have to buy health insurance, all right? The most unpopular thing which most people thought should have been unconstitutional, but we revealed it.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
REGAN: That was President Trump talking about what could be the next big agenda item for his administration, a revisiting of health care reform. Earlier this week, the president predicting Republicans and Democrats will eventually, he said, quote, come together on the issue. Well, he might have to do it without a key committee chairman. In an op-ed on foxnews.com, Tennessee Congresswoman, Diane Black, announcing she will step down as chairman of the house budget committee, because she's running for governor in 2018, in her home state. Chairman Black, she joins me right now in an exclusive interview. It's so good to see you and, I guess, congratulations are in order. 
REP. DIANE BLACK, R-TENN.: Thank you, it's good to be with you this evening. 
REGAN: So, walk me through what's next. I know you're leaving, and we're going to talk about your plans in a moment, but what do you anticipate being this, sort of, front and center policy agenda item there in D.C. in '18? 
BLACK: So, first of all, I think that we looked back on this last year, and I'm very proud and honored to have served as the budget chairman where all three of these measures, conservative bold measures came through my committee at the beginning of the year. We repealed and had a replacement for Obamacare, unfortunately, the senate didn't follow through. We were able to put out the most conservative budget in 20 years, and begin attacking our deficit spending. Again, the senate did not follow through on their measure. But we did at least change that conversation and the culture there in the House of Representatives, and I think that that will continue this year. 
And then, third is to get the tax reform, which really helps those in the middle income and get results for our economy. So I'm very proud of that. And I think that there will be now an effort to maybe go back and look at health care and say, what can we do besides what we did in the tax reform bill of repealing the individual mandate, which will gives people an opportunity to be able to buy the insurance they want at a price they can afford, that's the beginning of this. But there's a lot of other things that can be unraveled in that bill as well. 
REGAN: I mean, look, you've got the repeal in, but not the replace parts. So, you know -- but it's going to be challenging. I mean, he may need to bring everybody together, I'm sure that everybody is going to want to weigh in on this. I've looked at it many different times, many different ways, congresswoman, there is not an easy fix for health care. I mean, if it were, somebody else would have figure it out by now. 
BLACK: It's not. But I will tell you that here in the state of Tennessee, we were doing it the right way. We had policies within our state that we had that single-payer system. We were the pilot project here in the state of Tennessee. I was the state legislator. When we repealed that and put something in place that really did give people an opportunity to choose what they want at a price they could afford. And when Obamacare came along, we were told here in the state of Tennessee by the Obama administration, no longer can you do what's working in your state. 
REGAN: Well, you may have an opportunity to do much more for your state. You're running for governor? 
BLACK: I'm running for governor, and I said that I was going to congress to do three things. I've been able to do that. And now I'm going to bring that bold conservative agenda back to the state of Tennessee, a state that I've served in state legislator that I loved. And I'm looking so forward to being back in my state and being a part of the solution here in our state. 
REGAN: Well, good luck to you, Happy New Year. 
BLACK: Thank you.
REGAN: Congresswoman Black, thank you. We're going to be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
REGAN: This is a nice way to end the night, check out this picture just posted by Donald Trump Jr. on Instagram, showing his dad, President Trump, well, photobombing his son and brother Baron there at Christmas dinner. It's pretty cute. I'll see you back here tomorrow night at 7, and tomorrow on Fox Business.

Hannity - Friday, December 15
On Friday, Sean walks through the corruption plaguing the FBI and Department of Justice currently and talks about President Trump's hard stance on the two organizations.




This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" December 15, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.






SEAN HANNITY, ""HANNITY"" HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity."" 
Tonight a bombshell report from The Hill's John Solomon and Alison Spann. Now according to their reporting, prominent women's right attorney Lisa Bloom secured a cash payment for a Trump accuser and attempted to arrange huge compensation for another potential accuser just days before the election in 2016. Now this entire story is absolutely shocking. 

Tonight we have very serious questions. Why would Lisa Bloom do this? Is it dirty politics at play? And part of the larger effort to undermine and destroy Donald Trump's campaign at the time. And will Bloom's actions make it harder for all the real victims of sexual misconduct to come forward in the future? We will cover all of that and more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. 
John Solomon's exclusive report is now sending shock waves all across the country tonight. Here is the headline. Exclusive prominent lawyer sought donor cash for two Trump accusers. Now the details from Solomon's report are beyond stunning. Well known women's rights Attorney Lisa Bloom attempted to arrange cash compensation from donors and media outlets for women who came forward or for women who were considering coming forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump and the lead-up to the election. 
Now The Hill is also exposing that Lisa Bloom's contracts required women to, quote, ""pay her commissions as high as 33 percent if she was able to sell their stories to media outlets."" In a statement to The Hill, Bloom confirmed that she did secure and attempted to secure these kinds of payments. But Bloom noted that obtaining money was not part of an effort to pressure women to speak out with accusations. 



Now, Bloom also told The Hill that the money was to be used for relocating clients for security if they felt unsafe. Now, Bloom also said that she did not contact Hillary Clinton or her campaign. But, Bloom refused to tell The Hill about any possible communication she may have had with Super Pacs tied to Hillary Clinton. And finally, Bloom added that she never encouraged the women featured in The Hill article to say things that they did not believe to be true and the women, in fact, did confirm that.
Now, we have also reached out to Bloom for comment. She responded to our request by attacking John Solomon and claiming that the report is part of a right wing smear. However, as we have noted, Bloom confirmed all the major parts of this breaking story. Now this includes Bloom securing money for Trump accuser Jill Harth. Remember Harth accused Donald Trump of making unwanted sexual advances in the 1990s. She filed a lawsuit against him in 1997. She dropped that lawsuit. 
Now, this is what The Hill is reporting about Lisa Bloom and Jill Harth which they have both confirmed. Now Harth says that in fact she did not initially ask Bloom for money even though her business she claimed was suffering from stories about her accusations. At some point, later on in the relationship, Bloom secured what The Hill described as a, quote, ""small payment from licensing photos to news outlets."" 
And Bloom also set up a Go Fund Me page for Harth. In addition to all that, The Hill is reporting that Bloom arranged for Harth to receive an almost $30,000 payment to help her pay off her mortgage. Jill Harth did tell The Hill that taking the money does not affect the veracity of her accusations. Now, we did reach out to Jill Harth for further comment, she did not answer our request. 
Now, The Hill also spoke to another woman, pay close attention to this. She chooses to be anonymous. Now this woman told The Hill's John Solomon and Alison Spann that she is a friend of Jill Harth and she was pressed by Lisa Bloom to go public with her accusations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump from the 1990s. Now, before we get into those details, it's important to note that this woman supported Trump in 2016 and is friends with people close to the President, including one of his attorneys. 
Now, the woman stressed to The Hill that no one connected to the President forced her to reveal details about her interactions with Lisa Bloom. The woman says that the reason she chose to speak out about Lisa Bloom is because she was disgusted by the fact that Bloom served as Harvey Weinstein's attorney when the sexual misconduct allegations first surfaced against him. As for the woman, and Bloom's interactions, well, this unnamed woman provided text messages, emails that showed that Lisa Bloom had a very strong anti-Trump bias. 
She also revealed to The Hill that Bloom appeared to have a deadline for her to speak out before the 2016 election. The timeline proves this. And the woman also detailed to The Hill that Bloom initially offered her $10,000 in the form of a donation to her favorite church. And this is where it getting interesting. As the election got closer and closer and closer and the polls got tighter and tighter, Bloom eventually increased the offer from 10,000 to $50,000 in a personal payment. 
It then went to $100,000. It then went to $200,000. And then just two days, November 6th, 2016, two days before the election, it went to $750,000. Now, what this means is Lisa Bloom was offering a fortune right before you, the American people, were going to choose who the next president was going to be. The woman said to The Hill that she decided to see how much money would be offered in the end. 
Now, Bloom claims the unnamed woman asked for at one point up to $2 million. But Bloom said that was a nonstarter. Here's the timeline of how all of this played out. Pay close attention. According to The Hill, on November the 4th. Bloom contacted the woman's friend. But the friend didn't put the woman on the phone because she was in a hospital bed. Bloom, according to the report, then took a flight in an attempt to see woman. 
All the way to Virginia from California. And the next day Bloom was able to connect with the woman. And then Bloom allegedly sent this text message. Here's what is quoted in The Hill report. Quote, ""I am confused because you sent me so many nice texts Wednesday night after my other client wasted so much of my time and cancelled the press conference."" Bloom texted then on November 5th, 2016 that, ""That meant a lot to me. Thursday, you said that you wanted to do this if you could be protected and relocated. I begged you not to jerk me around after what I had just gone through."" 
A little later, she added another text. ""You have treated me very poorly. I have treated you with great respect, as much as humanly possible. I have not made a dime off your case and I have devoted a great deal of time. It doesn't matter. I could have done so much for you, but you can't stick to your word even when you swear you will."" Two days before the election, November 6th, when the woman left the hospital, she agreed to sit down with Bloom in a hotel room, and that's where, according to the woman, just two days before the election, Bloom offered the whopping sum of $750,000. 
But, the woman still declined to take it. Now, to all of us, this whole thing is beyond stunning. What if it happened? Now, a logical person can only conclude that this was about politics for Lisa Bloom at least. Imagine for a second if the story came out on November the 6th, right before the election, would Bloom have acknowledged that this woman received all that money to tell her story? I doubt it. 
How would any campaign be able to deal with that and at least have a chance to make their case? Talk about November surprises. This is one, well, that would be for the record books. I want to make one thing clear. As you know, if you watch this program, regularly, sexual misconduct and abuse are widespread problems in this country. We know it's true. I am the father of a daughter. Sisters. It scares me. It is morally repugnant when it happens, and it's true it needs to stop. It has no place in our society. 
We have said that repeatedly for months on this show. Victims of sexual misconduct deserve to be believed. And, also, as we have been saying for months, any person that is accused of this type of behavior and they deny it, they too, deserve the presumption of innocence. And I have said that in the case of Democrats and Republicans. Numerous examples which prove people cannot rush to judgment because sometimes innocent people are hurt because the allegations are flat out untrue. 
Example and point, the Duke Lacrosse case. Those kids were innocent. Having their lives ruined. Richard Jewel in Atlanta falsely accused of being the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber. He didn't do it. Remember Ferguson, Missouri, Michael Brown, the mantra, hands up, don't shoot, that was all a lie. Also Freddie Gray in Baltimore. The media told you that those cops would be convicted. None of them were. 
However, what Lisa Bloom reportedly did or attempted to do cannot be discounted. Bloom claims to be a champion of women's rights and a voice for the voiceless. Yet, according to The Hill, she did secure a cash payment for Jill Harth that helped pay off the mortgage and arranged another, at least attempted to huge payment for a different woman. Now, this is the same Donald Trump that Bloom displayed a hatred for that is reported in The Hill. 
And all of this raises very serious questions not only about Lisa Bloom and her motivations here but other issues, how is the public to deal with this? Was Lisa Bloom really interested in helping women here? Or was the real goal, as you can see through the time line and the money going up and up and up and the push to the election, was this about stopping Donald Trump from winning the White House? And why was Bloom in contact with donors? What donors? Who are they? 
And were they tied in any way to Hillary Clinton? Now, these types of accusations are so serious this should all be above politics. We asked Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett about all of this is and here is what he told us. While it is not illegal to ask someone to donate money for a person to tell a story, it can be a crime if that money is intended to influence someone to lie in a court proceeding. It raises another question. 
Lisa Bloom said, she vetted these women. But my question is, okay, how carefully did you vet it? Show us the information. We would like to see the vetting that took place. I would like to see the evidence, the date, the times, specific examples. What has been uncovered by The Hill here is huge. Because it appears to fit a much larger pattern of attacks against the President. We have told you about the five destroyed Trump forces that are working around the clock to damage, delegitimize and destroy this president. 
We also have been reporting on, unlike the rest of the destroy Trump media, all the attempts to take this president down. For example, the surveillance, unmasking of Trump and associates by the Obama administration. We have the Clinton bought and paid for fake news. Russian propaganda, salacious dossier. They wanted that to be used to influence the election. And the week -- this week Fox News obtained the anti-Trump messages being exchanged between FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page where they discuss the quote, ""insurance policy"" against Donald Trump winning the election. 
What was the insurance policy? Then have you got the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller's team. They have been exposed as corrupted, abusively biased, incapable of conducting a fair investigation. And the list goes on and on and The Hill article, frankly, raises more questions. 
Joining us now is the journalist who worked hard. Broke this story wide open, from The Hill John Solomon. Let's go through this step-by-step. You see the time line from October 14th through November 6th. And the pressure that is being brought to bear now on this woman to go forward becomes astronomical and the payment gets astronomically high. Walk us through it. 
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: Yes. You know, I never thought I would live a day as a reporter where we would be talking about the sacrosanct, very personal decision of a woman to possibly come forward with allegations of sexual harassment or assault. And it would be turned into a game of Monty Hall, right? Behind door one, a month before the election I have $10,000 for your church. Closer to the election, I have $50,000 for you. Behind door, I have 100,000. The door four, 200,000. 
Two days before the election, I have door five, $750,000. It's an extraordinary thing. And you see this woman struggling. She has personal things she wants to worry about the security of her daughter. And the more that money creeps up, the more she has to struggle with the decision, do I take the money? Do I do what I think is best for me? It's an extraordinary story and I just never thought we would live to see the day where money was being thrown around like it was some sort of deal making. 
HANNITY: You know, we also know Lisa Bloom has a huge bias here. Now, let's go down this imaginary path because it seems that it could have been-- it could have unfolded before the country. Let's say the $750,000 was paid to this woman. 
SOLOMON: Right. 
HANNITY: How does anybody -- how does the public absorbed this, vet this? And what is the likelihood because we have never heard of this payment before that the public wouldn't have known about the payments. 
SOLOMON: Great question. It's a great question. And Sean, here's one the things, since the story broke, lawyers have called me and they raised a question that I had and yet contemplated. And that is, if the donors' intention and given this money to help the women, also wasn't hopes of influencing election, it might have been consider a fault under the jurisdiction of campaign donations. 
So, there is a whole another angle to this. We're going to have to report out and talk to lawyers and try to understanding. But there is no doubt the election was a deadline given to the women. That is not in dispute.  If the donor's intention, if they had been told this might help the election if you help these woman come forward, it could raise some election nearing issues that haven't even yet been raised in the public. 
HANNITY: All right. Let me go down this road, too, because I think this is very, very important. I don't know what the answer is, but if this had happened and the public didn't know about the payment, something like this, in my mind, having followed elections, my whole adult life could have changed the result of the election. That's how profound this is. That's why, you know, you don't have an opportunity to vet an accusation like this two days before an election. Do you? 
SOLOMON: No. That's a very good point. And remember one of the women who did come forward, she did get something of value. She got her mortgage paid off. So, money did change hands. Something did of value occur to one the accusers. And I can tell you tonight, Sean, I'm still working on this, but this may not be the only path of attempted request for money. There appears to be another line where an accuser may have sought a job or an investment from Donald Trump before the story of sexual harassment became public. 
So, we are continuing to dig. But, if the money was here, you have to start to look did it happen, other places as well. Some of our reporting indicates it is. And I think if people tune into The Hill the next couple of days, they may learn some more information. 
HANNITY: You brought a lot up about the Super Pacs associated with it and in favor of Hillary Clinton. And then there is an outright denial, wouldn't even answer the question if she had talked to them or we have no idea where this money came from? 
SOLOMON: Yes. She is very clear. Didn't talk to Hillary Clinton. Didn't talk to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Didn't talk to the Democratic National Committee. Not going to tell you whether I talked to a Super Pac. Now, the text messages state flatly she did. The woman who didn't come forward but was considering these offers said, hey, we kind of heard if we help Hillary Clinton. There might be able something for us here. Can you explain if the Clinton Super Pacs can help us? And she writes back and said, I just talked to them, they are not willing to pay you right now. But I can't sell your story. That is another part of --
HANNITY: Well, didn't she always say that she never got -- that she did this pro-bono, right? 
SOLOMON: She always did. And what you learned what pro-bono meant, I get 33 percent commission if I sell your story to the media. And you begin to think, a woman's very painful story, a concern about their own well-being. Coming out doing this and it's a commodity. It's a commodity being sold. 
HANNITY: Okay. I have heard all these rumors, I guess a lot of people have about some tapes that maybe out there. Have you heard anything about that and my last question, what's next as this story, I assume more will be coming? 
SOLOMON: Yes. I have not been able to corroborate any of the rumors about tapes. And you know, right now, we are with a very strong body of evidence, which are these text messages and these women's contemporaneous documents and Lisa Bloom's own admissions. 
HANNITY: How many text messages, emails do you have total?
SOLOMON: Hundreds. 
HANNITY: Will you release all of them just completely so people can read it? 
SOLOMON: We will have to talk to the sources. I mean, we have our -- but we will be reporting more on them as time goes along. 
HANNITY: Okay. Unbelievable story. John Solomon, thank you. 
SOLOMON: Thanks, Sean. 
HANNITY: I appreciate it. When we come back, more reaction to this exclusive story by John Solomon. 
And later, we will talk to President Trump's Attorney Jay Sekulow about this. Also, about Jim Comey, Peter Strzok. The exoneration before the investigation into Hillary Clinton and how that can be untangled, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to Hannity. And here with more reaction to John Solomon's explosive report from The Hill, we have FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Also Fox News contributors Tammy Bruce, Jessica Tarlov and also U.S. Trial Attorney Rebecca Rose Woodland. 
Let me start with the panel here. When you see the urgency, that you go from 10,000, to 50,000, to 100,000, to 200,000 to 750,000 as we now countdown five, four, three, two days until the election. What if it was paid? What impact could that possibly have an on election? What does it say if somebody decides to take money to come out with a story? How is the public to absorb that? 
REBECCA ROSE WOODLAND, TRIAL ATTORNEY: The problem here I see is that attorneys cannot go solicit clients. So, this woman was a client. You can't solicit them to be compensated for a possible lawsuit. Now, these women were supposedly going to come out, supposedly for this alleged harassment. And pursue claims against the then President-elect Trump. 
Now he is the President during an election cycle. It doesn't make sense, Sean. Because it's unethical. We have very restrictive rules as attorneys to a point that if you do pay and compensate people, there could be criminal repercussions. So I can't quite understand why there was, first there was 10,000, it went up to $750,000 for one of the alleged victims. For what? 
HANNITY: A lot of money. 
WOODLAND: She claims it was for compensation for them for security? But the reality is, you cannot ensure your clients with any money. 
HANNITY: Uh-hm. Jessica, what's your reaction to this.
JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's a Lisa Bloom problem for sure. I know we've talked a lot about the Me Too Movement and whether we believe them. 
HANNITY: What if it came out two days before the election? What if that came out?
TARLOV: Right now I think we're up to 19 accusers, we were at 16 before last week. So, it's not all of that. 
HANNITY: Jessica, this isn't politics. I want to know because when women are treated horribly, I want the people that are responsible held accountable. But, when you see the money rising and an urgency and a political agenda behind this, that should scare every single person that would think about ever running for office in these types of operations exist. Wouldn't you agree? 
TARLOV: Absolutely. Chuck Schumer last week, there was a fake complaint against him where he was, you know, able -- they did the research and showed he wasn't even in the location when it happened. 
HANNITY: Look at the Duke Lacrosse case. Look at the UVA case.
TARLOV: A hundred percent. But that doesn't mean that there aren't thousands of women across this country who have legitimate claims. I think Lisa Bloom --
HANNITY: You are not answering my question. 
TARLOV: I am answering your question. 
HANNITY: What if it came out two days before? I will go to Tammy Bruce. 
TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, this is a problem that we even have to have this conversation. For me, we know that it is the veracity of the women that is very often questioned about what they want or what their agenda is. And, you know, what their motives are. When you have got something this corrupt going on, it hurts women who have legitimate cases because it is setting the stereotype right in front of everyone at every single level. 
So even though you may have a legitimate claim, you suddenly do have to wonder when it comes to motive, what if someone willing to say for three quarters of a million dollars? Can you trust the woman in saying what it is that she has been saying? Did that really happen to her? That is always what --
HANNITY: Can you answer that question? Your own question. 
BRUCE: Well, this has always what has been, women have been accused of. The problem is I think this is unique when you have someone like Lisa Bloom as we have seen who's been using the Weinstein case. Rose McGowan alleged that she was offered money to retract her accusations. So when you have got something like this, it sets the forefront. It will reinforce the negatives for women who have every right to be heard. But this is why this exists. And I think --
TARLOV: It doesn't discredit all of the women who has accused President Trump of actual harassment. 
BRUCE: In fact, it puts a shadow over every single one of them. That is a horrible. Every woman who does it cast as shadow. 
HANNITY: So, let me ask you there. So, she's offered all of this. And then she decides the woman is in the hospital and not responding to her texts in the hospital. Lisa Bloom flies out to Virginia. All the way from the West Coast. All right. And then the exchange takes, ""I'm confused because you sent me so many nice texts Wednesday night after my other client wasted so much of my time and cancelled the press conference. She texted, November 5th with three days now out of the election. That meant a lot to me. Thursday you said you wanted to do this if you could be protected and relocated. I begged you not to jerk me around after what I had just gone through."" 
And then she adds, ""You have treated me very poorly. I have treated you with great respect as much as humanly possible. I've not made a dime off your case and I have devoted a great deal of time. It doesn't matter. I could have done so much for you. But if you can't even stick to your word, you know, you swear you will."" 
BRUCE: Awful. 
HANNITY: Gregg Jarrett? 
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Lisa Bloom does not come out well in all of this. She appears to be driven by political animus to bring down Trump and make a buck off the whole thing. Now, look, it's not illegal for a donor to pay a person to tell the truth. But, if the intent of the donor is to get a witness to lie or embellish a story in relation to a court case like sexual misconduct, that would be suborning perjury. 
HANNITY: There is no evidence of that. But there is no evidence to that they really cared about veracity. For example, Gregg, isn't there a big difference between the tabloid newspaper that pays for stories the way the public views them in terms of credibility versus a news organization which should not ever take money, I know, they pay for pictures. 
JARRETT: You're right. 
HANNITY: You know, back door way to pay people sometimes, but it's really a difference, right? We know that these tabloids pay. 
JARRETT: Yes. 
HANNITY: Sometimes they are right. Sometimes they may not be. They don't have the same standards as a real news organization. Right? 
JARRETT: That is right. Look, in the O.J. Simpson murder case, a key witness in that case who saw him fleeing the scene was never called to the witness stand because she sold her story to tabloids and prosecutors knew she would be shredded on the witness stand. But news organizations is even worse. And the worst witness against Lisa Bloom is her own client who said, you just want me to bury Trump. For what? For personal gain. Greed. 
HANNITY: All right. Let me have an exit questions from everybody. To me, I believe this is going to have a profound impact on these issues going forward. Quickly, how big an impact? 
WOODLAND: A huge impact. Now, it discredits the women who come forward, who come forward and don't want to be paid. This makes it seem like everyone is getting paid for a story. And most of these women really were affected and they don't want to be paid. I'm not talking about. 
HANNITY: What if it would happen to a Democratic presidential candidate you like, Jessica? 
TARLOV: I think it would be just as terrible and I think -- 
HANNITY: And if the voting public -- 
TARLOV: -- does everyone a disservice. 
HANNITY: If the voting public doesn't hear that money was paid, is that fair? Should there be a law against that? 
TARLOV: I mean, I don't write statutes. 
HANNITY: I didn't ask you if you write them. Should there be a law? 
TARLOV: It sounds like there should be as much information, as much transparency as possible. 
HANNITY: Two days the election, somebody makes an allegation, Tammy. Does the public have a right to know in that case? 
BRUCE: I think the public has a right to know as much as possible. But let me tell you, this is also just what we do know now. Who knows what else was occurring? If this has actually come to the surface, you can imagine what the iceberg is under the tip. So, this is our problem. 
HANNITY: Greg, if it's your presidential candidate two days before the election? 
JARRETT: It's reprehensible, it's unconscionable. And now all of the women represented by Lisa Bloom or Trump accusers have had their credibility diminished if not absolutely ruined. 
TARLOV: I don't think the majority of Americans think that I think people watching this will think that because of what was just said. 
HANNITY: In the future. I agree with Tammy. 
BRUCE: I do, too. 
TARLOV: Well, I guess I'm up and out. 
HANNITY: All right. Coming up. Attorney General Jeff Sessions says, he is taking seriously the concerns being expressed about demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Of course his wife. We will tell you about that. Will Sessions appoint a second special counsel? President Trump's Attorney Jay Sekulow will weigh in on that, and more straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher. After some tense negotiations, Republicans appear to have enough votes to pass that massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul. 
Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed to support it once the child tax credit was increased for working families. Tennessee Senator Bob Corker has also announced his support for the bill. He voted against the initial Senate bill because it increased the deficit. 
The final version of the House-Senate conference bill lowers the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. And it cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The bill does not repeal the estate tax. 
Under the tax plan individuals will no longer be required to buy health insurance or face a penalty. THE house could vote on this bill as soon as Tuesday and the Senate some time later in the week. If news breaks out, we'll break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to ""Hannity."" 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you have to say about Trump's legal team calling for another Special Counsel? This one specifically about Bruce Ohr, an official here and his meetings with Fusion GPS and his wife having worked with Fusion GPS, and would you consider such a Special Counsel. 
JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to take seriously the concerns that have been expressed. I just would say to you, Deputy Rosenstein is testifying before the Congress again just yesterday and we want to be open with him. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: That was the Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier today telling reporters that he will take seriously the calls for a second Special counsel to investigate the connection between the DOJ and Fusion GPS. Joining us now, he is the head of the American Center for Law and Justice and the president's counsel. Jay Sekulow is with us. 
JAY SEKULOW, HEAD, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Hi, Sean. 
HANNITY: I don't only want one for this. I want one of -- yes, on the dossier, Fusion GPS. He is meeting with him, Bruce Ohr. His wife works for them doing anti-Trump research in the lead-up to the campaign. What about the fix being in with James Comey and Peter Strzok. 
Peter Strzok and Lisa Page both anti-Trump and pro-Hillary, that would reopen the entire email investigation because they exonerated before they investigated. And then, I'm not even talking about Uranium One and surveillance that are unmasking, Jay. You know, how about, all of these needs to be investigated. 
SEKULOW: Well, the last you mentioned is something -- I mean, they are all serious. But the last one you mentioned, I mean the idea of that it may well be that this dossier put together by Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele and now Bruce Ohr's wife, Bruce Ohr was fourth ranking official at the Department of Justice may serve as the basis upon which a FISA warrant was issued. 
Remember, that first time they went for that FISA warrant, it was turned down. Then they get it later. Was it based on this? And if it was based on this, I mean you are talking about the fruit of the poisonous tree. I mean this whole idea that this would somehow -- you know it could even exist within our system of justice, frankly is astonishing. But, Sean, you look at these interconnections and this is really serious to the operation of justifiable. That's what's at stake here, the Constitution. 
HANNITY: But it is possible that Hillary Clinton -- and then Hillary Clinton's campaign and she is controlling the DNC according to Donna Brazile that she bought and paid for Russian propaganda dossier with all the salacious details that could have been used to issue a FISA warrant against candidate Trump -- president-elect Trump and his entire team? Now, legally speaking, if that happened, wouldn't that render any information that they received out of that under false pretenses -- I mean illegal pretenses? 
SEKULOW: Yes, I mean, if in fact -- when there is a lot of chatter about this, if in fact the FISA warrants were issued based on this unverified as James Comey said, salacious dossier which we know is there is no verification of any of it, nothing in it is correct. If that in fact was the basis upon which the FISA warrant was issued, well then, of course, you have a constitutional issue which is can the evidence derived from that FISA warrant, which resulted in unmasking be admissible? And I think the answer clearly would be no. 
HANNITY: OK, next question. 
SEKULOW: So it does raise a very, very serious specter of constitutional issues, criminal procedure issues. And I think it puts -- look, this whole unmasking scandal is a scandal in and of itself. But to put it in perspective, if it was based on that dossier, what have we come to? What is the court system allowed itself to get to? 
HANNITY: Do you agree with my analysis based on the May 2nd or early May draft by James Comey and then also edited by Peter Strzok, the anti-Trump guy that worked in the FBI that was involved in all these cases. Does that in any way the fix being in before they investigate it, even talk to Hillary or witnesses? That sounds to me like obstruction of justice by James Comey. 
SEKULOW: Well, that granted immunity. I mean, they granted immunity to witnesses and this exoneration letter was written before they interviewed the witnesses that were granted immunity. So go figure that out. I mean what prosecutor does that? And then if you look at the actual -- and we broke this out, Sean. 
If you look at what was drafted by James Comey and his draft and was edited by Peter Strzok and others, you look at things like there was big discussion, remember, the whole basis upon which this whole email situation came to light was the fact that the server was not secured. That it was located in a town house in Colorado.
In James Comey's original draft, when talking about the seriousness of this, he says this is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on servers not supported by full-time security staff like those found at the department and agencies of the United States government. That was omitted from the final report. He wrote it and then someone took that out. And that was the basis upon which this whole matter started in the first place. 
HANNITY: Let me go back to top story tonight. We now have John Solomon's explosive report. And what we are seeing is intensity and financial rewards going up and up, and up starting in October. We are at first 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, then we get to two days before the election, $750,000. 
That we don't know where the money came from but being offered to a woman in exchange for her, quote, story about Donald Trump. If that story can come out, I doubt we would have known it was paid for because we didn't know that anybody was being paid up until today. You got to help me through this what that would mean in terms of trying to influence the American people 48 hours before they go to the polls.
SEKULOW: Well, look, I mean if you look at the entire situation, you put all of these into contest, what was taking place here. These were -- look, campaigns are rough business. Everybody understands that but what you had going on in the John Solomon's piece in the Hill, is this escalating value of the stories as the election gets closer. 
And the de-escalation of that value when the election is over and if you look at some of the trail of email of that site and then see how this goes, it was interesting that the person that offered the $750,000 as, John, reported then take the money and... 
HANNITY: What if she did?
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: But if you think about it, the phony Russia salacious lies. They are paid for by Hillary Clinton, Russian connection -- collusion if you will. Now have you two days before the election. A massive sum of money for somebody to make an accusation they can't possibly be vetted in that period of time. 
SEKULOW: Well, because what have you is, Sean, and this is -- look at the whole process. You talk about the need for a Special Counsel. Look at all of this that's going on. And then you go back to the Department of Justice itself -- and the FBI and, like you, I have tremendous respect for the agents that put their lives on the line for us every single day, defending this country, defending our liberty, defending our freedom. 
But I will tell you what I don't appreciate. I don't appreciate a Department of Justice that not only had determined the case before the evidence came in but was completely and it's become very clear here, conflicted on multiple levels. And that is not -- I didn't think Republican, Democrat, independent, no one in our constitutional republic should take that as OK. 
It's not OK. And I think Chris Wray has got a big job to do ahead of the FBI in -- by the way, you know, we talk about the deep state. You don't know what's so deep for this. This is right at the surface. These are leadership issues and I was glad to say that General Sessions today said that they are taking this issue seriously of a Special Counsel? 
(CROSSTALK)
SEKULOW: And that was all -- but you know what, there is a process they go through. They need to go through that process in evaluating the Special Counsel. 
HANNITY: Jay Sekulow, thank you for being with us. 
SEKULOW: Thanks, Sean.
HANNITY: When we come back, President Trump earlier today spoke at the FBI's National Academy. We're going to tell you what he had to say. We will get reaction at Sebastian Gorka, Sarah Carter. And I have a message about you and this show, it involves you -- our loyal viewers. Straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a shame what's happened with the FBI. But we're going to rebuild the FBI. It will be bigger and better than ever. But it is very sad when you look at those documents and how they have done that is really, really disgraceful. 
And you have a lot of very angry people that are seeing it. It's a very sad thing to watch. I will tell you that. And I'm going today on behalf of the FBI -- their new building. And you know, when everybody -- not me, when everybody, the level of anger, and what they have been witnessing with respect to the FBI is certainly very sad. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was the president earlier today before he departed for the FBI's National Academy in Quantico, Virginia where he spoke at a graduation ceremony for law enforcement officials for the United States of America and around the world. 
The president is rightfully upset with some of the blatant bias being shown by top ranking officials, not rank and file at the FBI and the DOJ. Just to be clear. We have said this many times. We do have great respect for those men and women of law enforcement in our country. Who save us every day and put their lives on the line. And we know the president feels the same way. Here is what he said earlier today. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It's an honor to stand here today with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. I am here not only to congratulate you but to honor you for your courage and your devotion. And I want you to know that with me as your president, America's police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the White House, more loyal than anyone else can be.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: With us now with reaction Fox News national security analyst, former deputy assistant to the president, Sebastian Gorka and investigative reporter Sarah Carter. It's so sad because if you have one bad cop, you know, people want to use -- they will forget about the 99.9 percent. Same with the FBI, same with intelligence officials, those that work hard to protect us, put their lives on the line every day, Sarah. 
But when you have the head of the FBI, James Comey, working with Peter Strzok, and they are writing an exoneration of Hillary Clinton before they do their investigation, that's not equal justice under the law. Peter Strzok who thinks for some reel reason God appointed him to save the country and that they are building insurance policies in case Trump wins, this is corruption, I think, at the highest level we have ever seen, your reaction? 
SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: Well, yes. I mean, I am talking to field agents today -- a number of field agents and retired FBI agents. And they have the same sentiment as President Trump. Remember, people want to criticize President Trump but what we have seen on the seventh floor is something that we have never seen before. 
And people have said this over and over again, never seen this type of behavior within the FBI which is so blatant. And you know, Sean, what was even more interesting to me was they were telling me they were at an event. All of these field agents and some military officials were there and they said everybody was worried about Russia collusion with Trump. Instead what we're seeing is FBI seventh floor collusion with Clinton. And that's how they are feeling. 
HANNITY: All right. Sebastian Gorka, I know how you feel about law enforcement. We all feel the same way. But this is real collusion. This is real corruption. And there is no other way to describe what Comey and Peter Strzok did. The fix was it. The fix was in months before he did his investigation. To me, if I'm James Comey tonight, I'm Peter Strzok tonight. I'm thinking I better hire the best lawyers D.C. has. 
SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Sean, Sarah, is absolutely right. Let me tell you my personal experience. I have worked closely with thousands of agents and analysts. I was in the White House earlier this week for the Christmas celebrations. And so was another retired agent from the FBI who had at least 20, 25 years in. He recognized me, and he came up to me and he said, the bureau's reputation is shot. 
And it's not because of the people who are protecting us on the streets in the terrorism task forces. It's because of a handful of bad apples, of bent cops, corrupt cops. And, Sean, the saddest thing is, we are getting the documents now. And I'm seeing emails of collusion inside the FBI to protect Hillary Clinton. 
Because they think she is the next president. And in the CC Line (ph), I'm seeing names of agents I highly respected and have worked with who once they got to the seventh floor, Sean, that's it under the Obama administration they became political hacks. And it's going to take years to rebuild the FBI. But the president said it today, he is going to rebuild it. And he can rebuild it. 
HANNITY: It needs to be rebuilt. And the same -- by the way, top people, former Obama people within the Intelligence Community before this was all said and done. I believe this house of cards falls. 
You know, your story yesterday about reverse targeting, the misuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give the intelligence community that you reported, Sarah, that doesn't even get into the dossier issue. 
Bought and paid for by Hillary with salacious Russian propaganda lies to influence an electorate. That doesn't get into the Uranium One deal. I'm not sure how we untangle all of this in the best way to do that, your thoughts on it? 
CARTER: Well, I think the best way to do that is one step at a time -- one story at a time, Sean, one investigation at a time. And that's what we have done over the past year. And that's why we see this yarn unraveling, peeling back the onion as you always say, one layer at a time. And now with -- you brought up the dossier, such a great point. 
And we see now that Bruce Ohr's wife was hired by Fusion GPS to help with this dossier. I mean, this is incredible stuff. We would have never discovered this, had we not done it one story at a time. And I think we need to continue that. Be very factual. Find those facts, present them to the American public so that they know what's going on and so that we can clean up our system because this is still the greatest country on Earth. And we still have the greatest system on Earth. 
HANNITY: If intelligence is misused and people are paying people for stories, if dossiers from Russia are being used, if -- you know, the misuse of intelligence, if literally we are ignoring bribery kicks backs, extortion and money laundering and we give 20 percent of our uranium away, and money is thrown but none of this steams to come to full resolution, Dr. Gorka. 
GORKA: Oh, it will. Oh, it will. The stories are just coming out thanks to, Sarah, thanks to, John, thanks to you, Sean, but... 
HANNITY: And you. 
GORKA: No, no. They are doing the heavy lifting and you are. But, Sarah, is absolutely right. She stole my thunder. We are the greatest nation on God's Earth. We are also the most powerful nation on God's Earth which means when you start to weaponize law enforcement, when you started to politically weaponize the intelligent community like John Brennan. Like the last administration, Eric Holder did. It is more dangerous than anything you can imagine. And that's why we have to step in now. People have to be investigated... 
HANNITY: That separates us from a police -- that separates us from a police state. 
GORKA: Absolutely.
HANNITY: If we don't get these issue resolve then there's -- the deep state illegally surveying Americans, we shred the Fourth Amendment protections of our constitution. We are going to lose the country. This is not a game that we're talking about here. These are severe violations of law and it all needs to come to a head. When we come back, a big announcement about this show and it involves you. Please stick around. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to Hannity. Unfortunately that is all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. Before we go tonight, I want to thank all of you who tune into this show every night watching at home. When we moved back to our 9:00 slot, oh, Hannity is dead meat. 
Well, thanks to you for the entire year, we moved to 10:00 and 9:00, this became the most watched cable news show in 2017. That's total audience demo, all the things that everyone talks about. You made that happen.  Your support we can't put a value on it, you give us the honorable of being with you here every night. 
I want to thank you and I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy new year. There's a lot of breaking news, we will be back. Until then we have Judge Jeanine and others that are going to be filling in and we hope you have a Merry Christmas. A happy Hanukkah, great New Year and we will be refreshed and ready to go January 2nd. We hope you will always set your DVR. Please never miss an episode. Have a wonderful holiday. We will see you in the New Year. Thanks for being with us.

Gold Star wife: President has been caring to me, my family
On 'The Story,' widow reacts to Trump's controversial call with Sgt. La David Johnson's widow.




This is a rush transcript from ""The Story,"" October 23, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.






MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Breaking tonight, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying the American people and the families of our fallen soldiers deserve answers about the deadly ambush in Niger. 
I'm Martha MacCallum, and that is where our story begins tonight. Four dead soldiers, many more questions than answers at this point. So, late this afternoon, General Dunford came out to explain to the greatest possible extent at this point, what happened. 

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: It's early in the morning on third of October, as I mentioned, U.S. forces accompanied that Nigerian unit on a reconnaissance mission to gather information. The assessment by our leaders on the ground at that time was that contact with the enemy was unlikely. Midmorning on October 4th, the patrol began to take fire as they were returning to their operating base. 
During the firefight, two U.S. soldiers were wounded and evacuated by French air to Miami. And that was consistent with the casual evacuation plan that was in place for this particular operation. Three U.S. soldiers who were killed in action were evacuated on the evening of 4th of October, and at that time Sergeant La David Johnson was still missing. On the evening of 6th of October, Sergeant Johnson's body was found and subsequently evacuated. From the time the firefight was initiated until Sergeant Johnson's body was recovered, French, Nigerian or U.S. forces remained in that area. 



(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So, let's get right to it with Fox News national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, who was in the front row today at that briefing at the Pentagon. Jennifer, what do you think are the biggest takeaways in terms of new information here? 
JENNIFER GRIFFIN, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Martha, it's interesting. General Dunford said he called Defense Secretary Mattis in Asia this morning to tell him he wanted to brief the press to address certain misconceptions about the attack in Niger that led to the death of those four U.S. soldiers. We now know the U.S. troops arrived in the village 85 miles north of the capital on October 3rd and stayed overnight -- it's not clear if that was part of the original plan. The attack occurred midmorning the next day. Sergeant La David Johnson's body would not be found for a full two days; 50 heavily armed fighters attacked the convoy after they left the village and were on their way back to the base. Dunford commented that -- confirmed that no drone was overhead when the battle started but said a drone was repositioned overhead within minutes. He said he had not yet viewed the video. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRIFFIN: Who found Sergeant Johnson's body? 
DUNFORD: The body was reported by Nigerian forces to U.S. forces. 
GRIFFIN: General Dunford, when did you alert the White House? 
DUNFORD: We notified the White House as soon as we had a soldier that was missing. It was probably around 9:00 or 9:30 Washington, D.C. time, the night of the 4th. And at that point, knowing that we had a missing soldier, we made a decision to make sure that all of the resources, to include national assets, were available. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GRIFFIN: General Dunford provided a new timeline as to when the U.S. troops called for support. A full hour after the first contact with the enemy. It would take two hours before the French warplanes were above. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DUNFORD: When they requested support, it took the French aircraft, French were ready to go in 30 minutes. And then, it took them 30 minutes, approximately 30 minutes to get on the scene. It's important to note that when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
GRIFFIN: That's different from the timeline first provided by the Pentagon that French warplanes were on site within 30 minutes. Fox News learned today, U.S. troops did not communicate with the French jets above and those warplanes never dropped any bombs. General Dunford said U.S. forces in Niger are not allowed to accompany local forces if they expect enemy contact and they did not expect resistance on this patrol. Martha? 
MACCALLUM: Jennifer, thank you very much. So, here now with more, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, former Green Beret Commander who served in Niger and helped train the Nigerian army there. He's also a Fox News Contributor. Col. Waltz, good to have you with us as always tonight. 
LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER GREEN BERET COMMANDER: Thanks, Martha. 
MACCALLUM: So, you listened to all of in this afternoon, what's your take away? 
WALTZ: Well, my first takeaway was I think General Dunford wanted to come out and have this press conference because there's this growing chorus, which is frankly a little ridiculous in my view that this is some type of covert war going on. There's kind of shock and surprise that we have this type of presence in Africa. You know, as we've talked about before, Green Berets, Special Forces are doing this very type of mission in 60 to 80 countries around the world as we speak. And in case of Niger, it's in a very bad neighborhood with al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, with Boko Haram, and with the ISIS and weapons pouring out of Libya since that country has fallen apart. 
Now, tactically, again, we are working through local forces. We're not in combat per se, but we're in a very dangerous neighborhood. And I think the investigation is going to uncover things like why did it take an hour to initially call for any type of support? As General Dunford said, perhaps it was just a very small initial contact and the team and Nigerian commander thought they could handle it. And then other pieces, the coordination with the French and the coalition, and where did the intelligence go wrong? Clearly, the route was compromised. Was it leaked from the villagers? Was there some type of mistake? All of those things though are lessons learned, and those are things that we will have to carry forward. These missions aren't going to stop. We are in a global war against terrorism. 
MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Let me ask you about this tweet by Representative Wilson who's been at the center of so much of this controversy. She said, ""Niger is @realDonaldTrump's Benghazi. He needs to own it."" Your thoughts on that? 
WALTZ: You know, I think, I think, frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. I think that's some political gamesmanship. And I would like to see, you know, writ large this, this, this kind of discussion, this political gamesmanship on Gold Star families, and how they deal with their loss get off the headlines. Every family deals with it differently. I've had families angry at me. Angry at the president. Angry at the war. I have had others be very thankful. And I just wish it would just, frankly, simmer down and go away. 
MACCALLUM: Do you think, you know, back in the early days of the Benghazi controversy if that administration had come forward and done what General Dunford did today, that it would've been more transparent that it might not have gone the way it did in terms of how many questions there were out there? 
WALTZ: Well, I think there was no doubt there was political spin, you know, in on election year, in 2012 on 9/11, when it came to Benghazi, and that we heard over and over again. It was because of some video from some guy in California. And not an attack by al-Qaeda on our embassy on 9/11. And I think, you know, I commend General Dunford for what he did today. He had laid out what we know, and then he laid out what we still have to find out. And again, there's no fault on that team or on the mission. It's, you know, there are lessons to be learned here so that we move forward and prosecute this fight. 
MACCALLUM: Col. Michael Waltz, always good to see you, sir. Thank you so much. 
WALTZ: All right. Thanks, Martha. 
MACCALLUM: So, General Dunford's defense came just hours after the widow of Sergeant La David Johnson spoke publicly today for the first time about her controversial phone call with President Donald Trump. Myeshia Johnson, standing by Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson's account of the conversation. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MYESHIA JOHNSON, WIDOW OF SERGEANT LA DAVID JOHNSON: Yes, the president said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyway. And I was -- it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband name. The only way he remembered my husband's name because he told me had my husband report in front of him. And that's when he actually said, La David. I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband name. And that what hurt me the most, because if my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risks his life for our country, why can't you remember his name? And that what makes me upset and cry even more because my husband was an awesome soldier.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: One hour after that interview aired, President Trump tweeted this: ""I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sergeant La David Johnson and spoke his name from the beginning without hesitation,"" and so on and on this goes. My next guest is also a Gold Star wife, Britney Jacobs, her husband Marine Corps Sergeant, Chris Jacobs, was killed during a training exercise six years ago and she joins me tonight. It's good to have you here, Britney. Good evening to you. 
BRITNEY JACOBS, GOLD STAR WIFE OF CHRIS JACOBS: Thank you for having me. 
MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, it's -- obviously, we all feel for her, and you can put yourself in her shoes far more than most of us. What's your reaction to all of the back and forth, that the president is still tweeting about this? What does it make you feel? 
JACOBS: First and foremost, I just want to send my condolences to Ms. Johnson and her family. This is such a difficult time, I lost my husband, as you know. I know what it feels like, it hurts, and it's hard. And emotions are just really high right now with her. Honestly, the president has been nothing but amazing to me and my family. And I think it's sad the way the media, not the media but per se the way everyone is politicizing it. 
The president, I think, when he called her, I think he had the best of intentions. I feel that no president would call a family member, especially as soon as they lost their loved one and say, you know, anything that they think that would offend them or upset them. By no means are her feelings wrong, and it hurts, but it's just -- it's a sad thing that has happened. 
And I think that people just need to step back and give the president a chance and see that, you know what? He was trying to do the right thing. He was trying to support the family. And just see the good in it. I feel like he was trying to be supportive and caring. And I feel like it's just been twisted all around. That's not the president that I know and that I have an experience with he's been so caring to me and my family.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: You know, I thought it was very interesting when we just spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz. Because he said that he has spoken to grieving families, and he said sometimes they respond very well and sometimes they're very angry at you. And I think everyone understands both of those reactions. I mean, you're going to have felt about what they were doing there. Whether or not, you know, you feel it's right or wrong. There are so many complicated feelings with how anybody takes it in when they receive this news or that outreach. Go ahead. I'm sorry, you were saying? 
JACOBS: I said, and have you lots of questions. I'm sure she is just wanting so many answers right now and she's not getting them. And I know that's difficult, too. It will come in time, but I know it's difficult for her. 
MACCALLUM: Yes. She talked about, you know, not being able to see her husband's body and, you know, we just heard from General Dunford. He said that you know, sometimes we don't recommend it. I mean, that is so heartbreaking. And you can feel her pain on that. You know, what's your response to that? 
JACOBS: My heart goes out to her for that because that would rip my heart out. It took me a while to be able to view my husband after his death. But I was very blessed and thankful that I had the chance to view him. Yes, my heart breaks for her because I cannot imagine not being able to see him if I wanted to and say my last goodbyes. 
MACCALLUM: Brittany Jacobs, Gold Star Wife, we thank you for your sacrifice and your family's sacrifice and your husband's sacrifice, of course. Thank you so much for talking with us tonight. Good to see you. 
JACOBS: Thank you so much, ma'am. 
MACCALLUM: So, still to come, a surprise turn of events in the Russia investigation as Hillary Clinton's name is now associated with this probe. So, what is going on with that? One of her biggest backers reportedly, the focus now of a criminal investigation here. The man who literally wrote the book on the Clintons, Peter Schweizer, here with his exclusive insight after this. And President Trump going to bat for historic tax reform. Is it enough to win over the taxpayers of America? Karl Rove joins me next. Plus did, a member of Congress threaten the president? We will play it for you and you can decide when we come back. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
REP. MAXINE WATERS, R-CALIF.: I will go and take Trump out tonight.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight, new headlines in the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But this time it is the Democrats that are in the spotlight. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly opening a criminal investigation to Tony Podesta. You've heard his name for quite some time related to all of these issues. He's the brother of Obama and Clinton confidante John Podesta who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. Their accusations that Tony Podesta's lobbying firm may have violated the Foreign Agents' Registration Act, which is known as FARA by failing to properly disclose work that they were doing on behalf of the pro-Putin- Ukrainian think tank in Russia that tried to influence the Obama White House. We are going to unravel all of this for you, I promise. 
Plus, there are some new reports on a cell of Russian spies who ran in the same circle of money and power as did Bill and Hillary Clinton. So, what about that? Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and Author of ""Clinton Cash,"" the untold story of how and why foreign businesses and governments helped make Bill and Hillary rich. Peter, welcome back. Good to see you tonight on THE STORY. First of all, you believe that Tony Podesta, that this is a real issue? 
PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: Yes, it's a huge issue. The Foreign Agents' Registration Act was launched in the 1930s in the wake of Nazi attempts to influence American politics. And the law is very clear, if you're doing work for a foreign government or a foreign government entity like this so-called Think Tank. You're required to register with the Justice Department, and they do that so that people know who you're meeting with and, you know, who's paying you to do those activities. Based on these reports, John Podesta's -- sorry, the Podesta Group did not register with the Justice Department. That's a huge issue. 
MACCALLUM: And Paul Manafort has the same issue with the same group, correct? 
SCHWEIZER: That's exactly right. They were both working for the same group. It's also interesting to point out, the Podesta Group, this lobbying firm, also was a lobbyist for Uranium One -- beginning in 2012 to the tune of $180,000. So, lots of interesting connections with the Podesta Group. 
MACCALLUM: All right. And what about the $500,000 Clinton -- Bill Clinton speech. How does that play into this? 
SCHWEIZER: Well, that ties into 2010 when they're trying to get the approval of Uranium One to be sold to the Russians. Bill Clinton gives a half a million-dollar speech in Moscow, which is basically three times more than he had ever been paid to give a speech in Russia before. And the company that paid for that was an investment firm that, of course, was pushing Uranium One as an investment that people ought to invest in. 
MACCALLUM: So, how does all this happen -- I'm sorry because I remember that, you know, when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, the Obama administration was concerned about the Clinton Foundation and all their deals, and Bill's speeches and all of that, the former president's speeches. So, when all of this is going on, how is there no oversight from the Obama administration that would've led someone to say, hey, guys, this is, this is not cool. You need to straighten this out. 
SCHWEIZER: You know, it's a great question, Martha. There was no oversight. And here's the thing: both President Obama and John Kerry, when he was Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee at Hillary Clinton's confirmation hearings, they said you're required as a condition of being secretary of state to disclose the flow of money, and in the Uranium One donations, they failed to do that. Millions of dollars they did not disclose. It only became exposed when we went through Canadian tax records. So, a lot of evidence that there seemed to have been a cover-up to try to prevent this money from being disclosed. 
MACCALLUM: I mean, you know, it seems pretty simple in a way. If there is nothing there, then there was no reason to not go through the proper registration with FARA and to be transparent about it if there is nothing to be --
SCHWEIZER: That's right.
MACCALLUM: -- cloudy about. Peter Schweizer --
SCHWEIZER: I think that's exactly right. 
MACCALLUM: Thank you very much. Go ahead. 
SCHWEIZER: If you don't have anything to hide, you don't have anything to hide. 
MACCALLUM: Yes, it seems that way, right. Thanks so much. So, David Bossie joins me now in New York, former Trump campaign deputy manager and Fox News contributor; and Mary Anne Marsh, former senior adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry. 
So, Mary Anne, let me start with you. I mean, it seems that if there is no problem, then why would you not go through the proper channels and just make sure you are dotting your I's and cross your T's here why keep it under wraps? 
MARY ANNE MARSH, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY: Well, I think an important fact here, Martha, is that Hillary Clinton had nothing to do with the Uranium One decision. Period, end of the sentence. She wasn't involved with it. 
MACCALLUM: She was on the committee, the (INAUDIBLE) committee, and she had to sign off on it. 
MARSH: No, she did not participate in the decision. It's a board --
MACCALLUM: But she's on the committee, Mary Anne. Her name is on the committee. 
MARSH: No, that's a fact and Barack Obama is the one who approved it. 
MACCALLUM: So, she wasn't doing her job? I mean, which is it? 
MARSH: No, she did not participate in that decision. 
MACCALLUM: But doesn't that seem rather convenient to you that she decided not to participate in this particular decision when she's on that board? That doesn't smell a little funny to you? 
MARSH: Well, you're either saying she recuse herself and rightfully so, given the circumstances that were just outlined in the previous segment. Or if she had participated in it, there'd be something nefarious, is it? So, which one is it? She recused herself. 
MACCALLUM: But did she recuse herself, specifically because her husband was giving speeches and because there were interactions with these companies? That's why? 
MARSH: I don't know the circumstances, Martha. In terms of the speeches, so I know there was a process where President Clinton would check speeches and other things. It is probably better at this point to disclose it if it has not been. But, in terms of her participation, I don't know the reason she didn't. But she did not participate. 
MACCALLUM: I mean, David, it feels like, you know, the same old, same old. They play by their own rules a lot. 
DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN DEPUTY MANAGER: Absolutely. And one of the only reasons that we found out about these connections is that we had a piece of litigation under FOIA for several years to finally get the memos that listed all of the Russians that Bill Clinton wanted to go meet with when he got his $500,000 payment. And, of course, it's the Uranium One guys. So, that's the connection. And it takes years to figure this out and John Solomon and the group on the Hill have been leading the way, no other mainstream media. All the mainstream media wants to do is talk about the Trump campaign and collusion when there's not one ounce of fact. But here, we have an important, important story and nobody is talking about it. 
MACCALLUM: So, you want to know more about this, Mary Anne? 
MARSH: Well, I mean, first of all, in Bret Baier's segment, earlier this evening, and in by Peter Schweizer's account where he was interviewed, the people that you're pointing fingers at did not donate money until 2007. So, in 2007, she was gearing up for a presidential race against Barack Obama. She was not the secretary of state. So, those are the facts here. And I don't think you can -- what you're trying to do here is kind of muddy the waters and try to conflate Uranium One with the --
BOSSIE: Actually, that's what the Clinton defense team does --
MARSH: Hold on, David. Hold on, hold on. 
BOSSIE: The Clinton defense team muddies the water. The Clinton defense team doesn't want to have the American people know that. 
MARSH: The fact is you are trying to conflate the Uranium One with Robert Mueller's investigation. And Robert Mueller's investigation is the United States of America against Russia and Vladimir Putin, not Democrat versus Republican. 
MACCALLUM: Yes, Mary Anne -- hold on, hold on, guys. But Mary Anne, if that includes, which obviously it does because they're in the middle of that investigation, and every American should want to understand any influence that Russia wants to have, but that also happens to go into this other avenue with Tony Podesta. So, that's where it's going because that's what happens whether you have an investigation. 
MARSH: Fine. Martha, I agree with you. And that's fine, and Tony Podesta, it's well known, did business with Paul Manafort. That is a fact. It's a well-known fact and has been reported for some time. And it appears he has FARA problem just like Manafort and Michael Flynn. None of whom registered, all of them did it retroactively. That's a felony. That's a problem. That's serious. So, I love the fact that Robert Mueller isn't going in down all the avenues here and has nothing to do with the party. 
MACCALLUM: All right. We started with Mary Anne, we're going to end with David. David, final thoughts. 
BOSSIE: First of all, Robert Mueller was the FBI Director, when this investigation seemed to have been covered up by the Obama Department of Justice. Eric Holder seems to have put this thing under a rug and they didn't tell Congress, they didn't inform Congress when this important decision about Uranium One's purchase was going on. No one in Congress knew about it, that's why this stinks to heaven. That's why Jeff Sessions must appoint an independent counsel other than Robert Mueller to investigate it. 
MACCALLUM: We're going to leave it there, guys. 
MARSH: Martha, last point. Last point. Last point.
MACCALLUM: Go ahead, real quick. 
MARSH: On 2015, there were letters sent on this matter by members Congress, the Oversight Committee. They have yet to have a hearing. They might have it now -- 
BOSSIE: They'll be seeing hearings now. 
MACCALLUM: All of these come up from The Hill story, which said that there was ongoing FBI investigation while this process of approval was taking place. But the guys on the committee didn't know about it. So, thanks, you guys. That'll make sense. Thank you, great to have you both here tonight. So, coming up next, this:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want to get it by the end of the year. But I'd be very disappointed if it took that long.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: So, will they take that long? And what does this plan actually include? Karl Rove here on that coming up next. And he was treated like a hero when he was released. Bowe Bergdahl's parents welcomed by President Obama to the White House rose garden; you remember all of that. But now, he is about to find out his fate for admittedly deserting his post and being turned over to the Taliban. Bergdahl speaking out about his time in captivity. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a disgrace to this nation, the uniform. There is no honor in his service. Especially, when you leave your buddies and brothers in arms behind and join the enemy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: And I think we're going to get our taxes. I think it's going to be --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: And I think we're going to get our taxes. I think it's going to be, well, hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that. There is a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. So it is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: That was President Trump speaking exclusively with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo, pushing full steam ahead to try to get the tax reform plan done. He calls it tax cuts though by the end of the year. The deadline is important so that the changes can be made for your 2017 return. There's a reason they want to get this done before the end of the year. So a lot of questions still remain about what is and is not in this plan because no one has actually seen it yet, including new reports that it could put limits on retirement contributions. President Trump quickly shooting that down on Twitter saying, quote, there will be no change to your 401k. This is always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays. 
Here now Karl Rove former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, and a Fox News contributor. Good to see you, Karl. Good to see you. 
KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening. 
MACCALLUM: So Mitch McConnell wouldn't really commit on the question of the 401k, and whether or not -- the question is how much you could deduct tax free of the money that you put into your 401k. So is that flexible or do you think, you know, do you stick with the president on that? 
ROVE: I think the president was pretty declarative about it and let's explain why they were trying to do that. Your contributions to your IRA or 401k, you pay the tax when you retire and take the money out. So it's taxed. It reduces your adjustable gross income on the front end, and you then -- because it's tax deductible and then you pay the tax when you retire, decades from now. The Roth IRA, you pay the tax when you put the money in and you take it out tax-free. So, if suddenly they reduce the amount of money you can put into an IRA or 401-K, it will encourage more people to get a Roth IRA and pay the tax upfront rather than a couple of decades from now. So this was an accounting gimmick, if you will, to take those taxes that would be paid in the future and pull them forward, thereby reducing the amount of -- that would add to the deficit. So the president was pretty clear. Let's not monkey around with it boys and girls. So we end up with something like that, leave it alone, and figure out some other way if you want to reduce the size of the deficit that it occurs as a result of this. 
MACCALLUM: I mean that's what it all comes down to. And clearly, for Paul Ryan, who is trying to figure out the numbers and how much revenue they need. So, and, therefore, how many tax cuts they can put into this plan. And he's kind of riding those numbers and trying to make sure that they work. And there's also this possibility that they may maintain the top -- you know, the millionaire tax bracket at 39.6 percent, or it might even go higher than that. What do you think about that? 
ROVE: Well, first of all, I'm not certain that this idea on the 401k's came from the house ways and means committee or the speaker of the house. We don't know where it came from. Nobody's fingerprints were on it. And the president was wise to quickly kill it so we don't spend more time on it. But look, they have a lot of work to do on this. And, this top bracket question is going to be an important question. I don't think there's any likelihood that they're going to lower the top bracket. I also don't think there's very much likelihood that they're going to raise it, what they may do is simply leave it where it is, and realize that the top rate is going to be at 39.5, and there's going to be essentially no tax break for people at the very top. 
MACCALLUM: All right. In terms of what we saw over the weekend, the hurricane relief moment, which was really special, I mean, seeing five living presidents up on that stage and all pulling together, and it's interesting the sort of, you know, buddy moments that we have seen emerging. And I think that everybody, you know, the people who are in this club, it's the most exclusive club in the world, and they're in it. So I just want to show a couple seconds of this moment between President Bush and President Obama, which is getting a lot of attention today. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: Disaster, but can be a new beginning. If we just do what we ought to do. And prove that the heart of America, without regard to race or religion or political party. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: So you saw that little, you know -- it's like boys in the back of the classroom snicker, snicker, and they look at each other. And I don't know if it was something that was happening in the front row, because they both seemed to be sort of looking out, or whether it was something going on with Bill Clinton. What do you think, Karl Rove? 
ROVE: Well, Martha, I'm sorry, but it's not what I think I know. I saw that same moment and it wasn't a snicker. It was a giggle on the part of President Obama. President Bush ducked behind President Clinton and said something, President Obama began to giggle. I actually have -- there is a report. You may not know this, but there are -- the activities of the former presidents are carefully cataloged by intelligence agencies. And there is a top secret report out on the college station five presidents meeting on Saturday as you can see, but it's also -- it's very secret, it's code word ha-ha-ha. So sorry -- I'd like to share with you what that joke was but --
MACCALLUM: Good thing have you that ha-ha-ha security clearance and you got to see it. 
ROVE: Exactly. 
MACCALLUM: Karl, thank you.
ROVE: It was actually a pretty good joke. It was a very funny joke and it only took three words. 
MACCALLUM: And you won't tell us what the three words were? 
ROVE: NO. No, I'm not going to. I'm sorry. I'd be breaking, you know, the bond. 
MACCALLUM: Here's three words, good, bye, Karl.
(LAUGHTER) 
ROVE: Top secret. 
MACCALLUM: Thanks, Karl. Always good to see you. 
ROVE: You bet. 
MACCALLUM: See you next time. All right. So when we come back tonight, remember this?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: He served the United States with honor and distinction.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: But Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl pled guilty to deserting his post and to running. And he's on the verge of finding out his fate for betraying his comrades and putting some of them in danger. He's talking about his time in captivity now. Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer played a role in getting Bergdahl home safely. His unique take is next. Plus, Congresswoman Maxine Waters ramps up the rhetoric against President Trump. You didn't think it could get any more ramped up, did you? Wait until you hear this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, a delay today in the sentencing for Bowe Bergdahl who faces up to life in prison for pleading guilty to deserting his post in Afghanistan back in 2009. Court proceedings resume on Wednesday. Tonight, Bergdahl is speaking out though about his life outside of captivity, telling the Sunday Times, quote, at least the Taliban were honest enough to say I'm the guy who is going to cut your throat. Here, it could be the guy I pass in the corridor who is going to sign the paper that sends me away for life. Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer played a role in getting Bergdahl home safely. He's also a CIA train-intel operative and senior fellow at the London center for policy research. Colonel, good to see tonight. What's your reaction to what he said? 
TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH SENIOR FELLOW: Well, first, look, the bottom line is the article 99 charge is being, you know, shown to be clearer every day. He is still a uniformed member of the military. Martha, what he's saying is giving aid and comfort to the Taliban. Think about this. A uniformed soldier of the U.S. Army is saying derogatory terms about his own service. You don't have to be in Afghanistan to be helping the Taliban like he did by walking away. Let's revisit everything that's happened. 
By the way, Fox News, Catherine Herridge, reported all of this in great detail way ahead of the curb two years ago. He abandoned his post. A great deal of effort was expended to try to recover him. Men were killed and injured badly in the process of trying to do this. We're talking about upwards of between seven to 10 dead. And most importantly, Martha, remember, his departure in going to the Taliban gave huge leverage by the Taliban against the United States and our Afghan allies. So, again, after all this time, he can't just sit down. 
MACCALLUM: Yeah. 
SHAFFER: . plead guilty and do the right thing. Instead, again, if I were his commanding officer, I would sock him with a second article 99 charge for saying what he's saying, and giving the Taliban legitimate propaganda for them to use against us in Afghanistan. 
MACCALLUM: You know, you hear all of this and you read his own words. He said he left his unit because, quote, one of the biggest s-something is being put in charge of our team. His father wrote to him and said, son, you've got to follow your conscience. So he took off. Now, you know, fast forward to the Rose Garden ceremony where he's there with the parents of Bowe Bergdahl, and Susan Rice and President Obama both suggesting that he served honorably. I mean, how do you square that? 
SHAFFER: Look, Martha, I served for thirty and a half years, and I worked for a lot of, you know, butt heads.
MACCALLUM: Right.
SHAFFER: . to say it that way. 
MACCALLUM: That's a nicer way. 
SHAFFER: I've never walked away. I've never failed to do my duty. And this is where -- clearly, there's a huge departure. This man decided to abandon his post, put in jeopardy his colleagues and comrades, and then in the end, again, this was not unknown to President Obama and the White House. The then chairman of the joint chiefs, the admiral in charge actually knew all of this. He was confronted by the troops while visiting Afghanistan that the fact that Bergdahl abandoned. And, again, I was part of the recovery effort. Martha, all of this was known behind the scenes to include classified information that cannot be released, but does support the article 99 charge. It's completely insane. 
MACCALLUM: Tony Shaffer, thank you very much. 
SHAFFER: Thank you, Martha. 
MACCALLUM: . lieutenant colonel, for being here tonight. This gets started on Wednesday. Good background. Thanks, Tony. 
SHAFFER: Thank you. 
MACCALLUM: So coming up next, some ugly rhetoric, when you thought it couldn't get any worse. It appears to be. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will go and take Trump out tonight.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: That was received with a huge applause in that crowd. The California Democrat, Maxine Waters, go too far in criticizing President Trump. Ben Shapiro and Richard Fowler on that, and another case of a curious cartoon in the Berkeley Newspaper when we come back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Congresswoman Maxine Waters ramping up her rhetoric against President Trump. The California Democrat started calling for the president's impeachment shortly after the January inauguration. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Republicans should step up to the plate and confront the fact that this president appears to be unstable. 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: When is the black community going to say, yeah, impeach him? It's time to go after him. I don't hear you. 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've said over and over again, I think he's the most deplorable person I've ever met in my life.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: But this time, some say that Waters may have taken it so far. Listen to what she said at a recent New York gala.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about even though I never met him, and with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: Then, there's that. Ben Shapiro, editor in chief at DailyWire.com, and Richard Fowler, national syndicated radio talk show host and a Fox News contributor. 
Richard, I'm just watching this, and it really isn't that surprising. I mean, you know, when you look at all the things that Maxine Waters has said since the inauguration. But I can't help but wonder if previous president, President Obama or President Clinton, if someone had stood up and said that about them, don't you think the outrage on the other side would have been uncontainable? 
RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: And I think the outrage was uncontainable when Ted Nugent threatened to shoot the president, there was outrage on the left and it was uncontainable. 
MACCALLUM: He's not a congresswoman though. 
FOWLER: No, I mean, I get that. And I don't think that she was threatening to kill the president in this particular sound bite. I think that some from the right have sort of made this idea that she's trying -- threatening to kill him. I don't think that what's she's saying here. I think she's saying, I'll go and take him out. Just like when the president once say, I'm going to go take out Hillary Clinton and beat her in the next election, right? It's a very tongue in cheek saying. She's been in congress since 1991. Nobody believes that she's going to go to the White House and try to harm, physically harm the president in any way. 
MACCALLUM: All right. I gotcha. So you're saying that the rhetoric has evolved so dramatically on all side that this is sort of the way we talk now. Ben, what do you think? 
BEN SHAPIRO, DAILYWIRE.COM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: I think there is some truth to that. I think it's a pretty outstanding example of just how far the rhetoric has evolved. I mean, Maxine Waters have been saying pretty inflammatory things her entire career. There's a woman who once said at the L.A. Riots -- L.A. uprising, she's used charged language for 20-odd years. She one of the most corrupt member of congress. I don't think anyone is particularly surprised by this. But the shouting and cheering for the idea that I'm going to take him out tonight. It's the word tonight that really adds that extra flavor there. It's not just I'm going to take him out in 2018 or 2020. It's I'm going to take him out tonight that I think everyone is upset about and rightfully so.
(CROSSTALK) 
FOWLER: (INAUDIBLE) The president's rhetoric is almost just as bad. He said he could shoot somebody on fifth avenue and still be elected president of the United States, right? So his rhetoric is just as bad. So, I mean, I think to sit here and to criticize the Congresswoman Waters, we should also be criticizing the president for using the same type of rhetoric. 
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Devolved to such an extent that we sort of think of this as no big deal. Speaking of rhetoric, let's take a look at this cartoon that was put out in the Daily Californian, which sounds like a Sunday newspaper, but that's what they publish. It's Alan Dershowitz with his head sort of pushed through some sort of wall, and the images that are back there depict something on the Palestinian flag and an Israeli soldier shooting an unarmed person. And let's also put up what Alan Dershowitz showed us in terms of what was put up at the university on the bulletin board where there was a swastika draw drawn over his face. Ben? 
SHAPIRO: I mean it's pretty shockingly anti-Semitic stuff. This particular cartoon is straight from the pages of -- appearing in the Berkeley newspaper that suggestion that Alan Dershowitz is a tool of the Israelis. Not only the tool of the Israelis, the Israelis are engaged in Nazi occupation in which they're killing innocent children for no reason at all. And this is pretty obvious -- you know, anti-Zionism equaling anti- Semitism in this particular case. 
MACCALLUM: Let's put up a quote from an interview that you guys did at the dailywire.com with Alan Dershowitz, and he points out -- he says, you know, irony is two kind of word, its hypocrisy. Remember, this is a reaction to a speech in which I said that I support a Palestinian state, and he goes on to say I support the end of the occupation. I'm against Israeli policies on settlements. You know, and Richard, it just raises the question of whether or not there's some similarities between, you know, sort of the hard progressive left and this neo Nazi hard right. 
FOWLER: Listen, I've said all along. I think that there's racism on both sides of the aisle. I don't care how you split the cookie. I think there's racism in the Democratic Party. I think there's racism in the Republican Party. I think there's homophobia in the Democratic Party. I think there's homophobia in the Republican Party. I don't think homophobia, racism, xenophobia, sexism, I don't think they know party affiliation. I think there's hate in people's heart and there's nothing you can do about it. And I don't think it hides under one particular political cloak or another. Period. 
MACCALLUM: Ben? 
SHAPIRO: I mean that there's some truth to that. The question is how close is that hate to the heart of a particular movement? When you're talking about the anti-Zionism, antisemitism, some part of the left that seems a lot closer to the heart of the Democratic Party than the heart of the Republican Party.
(CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I've got to go. I'm getting counted down, you guys. But that was a really cheery segment. So thanks a lot. Both sides are horrible. An emotional moment when we come back, after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Moving moment today, nearly four decades in the making. President Trump awarded the Medal of Honor to 71-year-old retired Army Captain Gary M. Rose. In 1970, Captain Rose was a 22-year-old medic, dropped into Laos on a secret mission that would not be declassified for nearly 30 years. Captain Rose is credited with saving 60 wounded men over four days of intense combat. Even though he was himself severely wounded. Eyewitness accounts say that Captain Rose rushed into enemy fire to save his fellow soldier again and again. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: In reaction during those four days Mike valiantly fought for the life of his comrades, even if it meant the end of his own life. Mike, you will -- I may not have to say, you really, your will to endure, your love for your fellow soldier, your devotion to your country inspires us all. I have to tell you, that is something. Nations are formed out of the strength and patriotism that lives in the hearts of our great heroes.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
MACCALLUM: Captain Mike Rose and his family, we are thinking of them tonight. That's our story for this evening. Our story goes on though, tomorrow night at 7:00 right here. In the meantime, stand by. Tucker Carlson is right after this.

How bad was the casting couch in Hollywood?
The Weinstein scandal continues to expose the scandalous culture; reaction on 'Hannity.'




This is a rush transcript from ""Hannity,"" October 16, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.






SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Thanks, Tucker. And welcome to ""Hannity"" and this is a Fox News alert. We have a big announcement about breaking news coming up later in the show. 
But first, the uproar over Harvey Weinstein, it continues to evolve every hour of every day as more and more Hollywood elites are being exposed as hypocrites responsible for covering up the deeds of a predator. Now tonight, we are going to reveal just how close Weinstein was to the Clintons and how Democrats, Hollywood and those in the press in this country all helped enable this predator. 

Now, you're going to hear from two women about just how bad the ""casting couch"" is in the entertainment industry tonight. And also, the NFL's national anthem controversy is not going away. Hillary Clinton tonight siding with the cop haters and now the man who started it all, Colin Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL claiming that the league colluded to keep him from playing. Really? Are his charges true? We investigate tonight. All of that in our big breaking news opening monologue. 
All right. The fallout continues for Harvey Weinstein. So, after multiple accusations of sexual assault and harassment, Harvey Weinstein is now under criminal investigation both in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Now Weinstein could face serious charges that could put this mogul behind bars. We are told it could be up to 25 years. 
Now, Harvey Weinstein's own brother Bob Weinstein is now calling his sibling sick and depraved and telling the Hollywood reporter, quote, well, ""I want him to get the justice he deserves."" That's his brother. 



And on Saturday morning, the Motion Picture Academy, they voted to boot the once revered director from its membership. Now sadly, this is the same Motion Picture Academy that still recognizes and worships a convicted pedophile Roman Polanski and people like Bill Cosby among its ranks. Are they going to clean it up altogether? 
Which brings us to the next point. The accusations surrounding Harvey Weinstein's behavior should come as no surprise. After Hollywood's ""casting couch"" culture of sexual abuse, it's been an open secret in Tinsel own, in the media, for all too long by those seeking roles in the big screen.
For example, actress Tracy Melchior, she is going to join us in a few minutes, talked about the commonality of this culture in Hollywood with Larry King. She was warning us about this back in 2005. Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, OCT. 12, 2005, CNN)
TRACY MELCHIOR, ACTRESS: There was just a lot of -- in case you hadn't heard, there is a lot of wealthy men in Hollywood who like attractive girls to be around and sometimes they will offer to pay for things for you. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now Tracy will tell her story -- and it's tragic -- later in the program, and what she experienced. And she's part of an ever-growing number of actresses and women calling out this despicable, disgusting toxic culture. Actress Rose McGowan, who is accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, she tweeted Hollywood was, quote, ""a rape machine,"" and that she was blacklisted because she dared to tell the truth.
Now, this culture also extends to the music industry. Kaya Jones, remember her? She's been on the show. Former member of the Pussycat Dolls. She's speaking out tweeting, quote, ""My truth. I wasn't in a girl group, I was in a prostitution ring. Oh, and we happen to sing and be famous while everyone who owned us, they made money."" Kaya will also join us later in the program. 
Now sadly, not everyone is condemning the ""casting couch"" culture in Hollywood. And in fact, of all people, Woody Allen -- you might remember, he is the actor who married his longtime girlfriend's daughter, the great moral barometer he is -- he told the BBC, quote, ""Tragic for poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that his life is so messed up."" Woody Allen had to later clarify those remarks after being called out and then he condemned Weinstein. But what does he really believe? 
And then you have the mainstream media, NBC, others, who have helped cover up Weinstein's misdeeds for years. Let us not forget about Democrats, more than happy to take hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations from this movie mogul for decades. And this by the way includes the DNC, which is now taking heat for not donating last cycle's Weinstein's contributions to charity but rather three political groups. They really want that money. No word if the DNC will return or donate all the estimated $300,000 that received from the powerful producer over the years. 
And Hillary Clinton, she is up to her eyeballs in this. She's received tens of thousands of dollars from Weinstein, and last week she announced plans to donate that money to charity. What we learned over the weekend, the spokesman for the Clinton Foundation indicated the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Weinstein donated to the Clinton Foundation will not be returned. They spent it. 
And meanwhile, Hillary Clinton wants to lecture all of us about the misogyny epidemic in America? How out of touch can Hillary possibly be? Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, CNN)
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Sexism and misogyny are endemic in our society. And I do try to take readers on a journey with me. 
There seems now to be a willingness by more and more women and girls to claim their rights in a very explicit way. Not in an apologetic way. Not like, ""Oh, you know, excuse me, let me express my opinion."" But no, I have an opinion and I want to tell you what that opinion is. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: She is the same woman that took millions and millions of dollars from countries that systematically abuse women and literally kill gays and lesbians and also literally, you know, go after Christians and Jews. She's trying to distract from the deeds long associated with Weinstein. Now she's trying to -- her and her creepy husband. Watch this. Let's remember where we go here. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, CHANNEL 4)
CLINTON: All I can tell you is I did not hear those things. Look, we just elected a person who admitted sexual assault to the presidency. So, there are a lot of other issues that are swirling around these kinds of behaviors that need to be addressed. And I think it's important that we stay focused and shine a bright spotlight and try to get people to understand how damaging this is and the women coming forward, it's the only way that story will be told. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Excuse me, Hillary, your husband was basically a groper-in-chief, the entire time we were married to him. And in case you forgot, it's a little refresher, from those women that accused your own husband of sexual harassment, assault and even rape, and you sat silently by and assisted in engaging in character assassination, smears and slanders against those women who bravely spoke out. 
Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
HANNITY, JUNE 10, 2003: You described a scene where he was biting on your lips and then when it was all over, he was leaving, he said, ""You better put some ice on that.""
JUANITA BROADDRICK: Yes. And casually put on his sunglasses and walked out the door. 
KATHLEEN WILLEY, NOV. 7, 2007: It was a terrible ordeal for me. And I -- no woman should be subjected to it. It was an assault.
HANNITY: He assaulted you? 
WILLEY: Yes. 
HANNITY: He touched, grabbed, fondled, and kissed you against your will. 
WILLEY: Yes.
HANNITY: And it is an allegation that is not made by one woman, it's made by multiple women. 
WILLEY: Many of us. 
PAULA JONES, OCT. 13, 2016: I said, well, I may need to be going or something and the next thing you know he pulled down his pants. His whole -- everything. And he was exposed. And I said, I am not that kind of girl and I need to be getting back to my desk. 
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
HANNITY: And Hillary, you sat silent as your creepy husband went after and abused all of those women and you assisted in the character assassination of all of these women. And we all know by the way, Harvey Weinstein helped finance the defense of your husband's shenanigans. Now Weinstein literally bankrolled Clinton's defense team. Hillary, you had to know. Stop lying. We don't believe that you are a champion of women's rights. We will get back to Hillary in just a minute. 
But let's talk about late night host Jimmy Kimmel. Last week, Kimmel lashing out at his critics after they called him out for not shedding a tear, giving another emotional monologue about Harvey Weinstein's victims. And Kimmel said, he was not the, quote, ""Moral conscience"" of America. Well, this weekend, he doubled down on stupid. Let's watch stupid.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""SUNDAY MORNING""/CBS)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You've heard, there's one conservative commentator in particular who says, who made Jimmy Kimmel the moral arbiter? 
JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, ""JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!"": I am not. I mean, you know, I agree with them. I am nobody's moral arbiter. I mean, you don't have to watch the show. You don't have to listen to what I say. Like three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats. 
(LAUGHTER)
And then Republican numbers went way down like 30 percent or whatever. And, you know, as a talk show host, that's not ideal but I would do it again in a heartbeat. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, you don't mind if Republicans turn off your show? They're not watching anymore? 
KIMMEL: I don't say I don't mind. I mean, I love for everyone, I want everyone with the television to watch the show. But if they're so turned off by my opinion on health care and gun violence, then, I don't know, I probably would want to have a conversation with them anyway. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good riddance? 
KIMMEL: Well, not good riddance, but riddance. 
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Not good riddance, but riddance. OK, bye-bye. Now, it's clear, Kimmel is going down this same path as Stephen Colbert, wants to be a left wing comedian only.
 But Kimmel's attack didn't stop there. During an interview with The New York Times, Kimmel was asked if he thinks his critics are trying to influence what he talks about on his show. This is how Kimmel responded. Quote, ""Well, I think some of them are. I think some of them are just trying to get Fox News to hire them as on-air commentators. It's sad. You see people trying to engage me in battle that are just trying to give their careers a boost. I won't be a part of that with the rare exception."" 
All right, Jimmy. Let's engage over you being a creepy old man trying to get 18-year-old young girls to guess what is in your pants and grabbed what is in your pants with two hands and asked them to kiss it. Jim, you look like a creepy old man. We will show that tape in a second. 
Now, meanwhile, this weekend marked the six weeks now of the NFL. And despite Roger Goodell calling for all players to stand, some did not. And reports, according to them, players from four teams did not stand or come out of the tunnel for the national anthem. And the New Orleans Saints did something pretty despicable. According to the local paper, the announcer of the game asked for a moment of silence for a police officer that was killed on Friday. When the players kneeled, the fans didn't react well and they started booing in the stadium. The New Orleans coach said today it was a misunderstanding. 
Also over the weekend, Hillary Clinton defended the NFL players who kneeled during the anthem. Watch her. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLINTON: So, you have to resist what are very clear -- what we called dog whistles to that base. That's what the black athletes kneeling was about. That was not against our anthem or our flag. That was actually kneeling as a reverent position. It was to demonstrate in a peaceful way against racism and injustice in our criminal system. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now President Trump was asked about Hillary Clinton's remarks and here is what he said. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope Hillary runs. Is she going to run? I hope. Hillary, please run again. 
When you take a knee -- that's why she lost the election. I mean, honestly, it's that thinking, that is the reason she lost the election. When you go down and take a knee or any other way, you are sitting essentially for our great national anthem. You are disrespecting our flag and you are disrespecting our country. 
If Hillary Clinton actually made the statement that in a form sitting down during the playing of our great national anthem is not disrespectful? Then, I fully understand why she did not win. 
I think that her statement in itself is very disrespectful to our country.
(END VIDEO CLIPS) 
HANNITY: The president is right. Americans fought, bled and died for this country fighting under that flag and everyone should at least unite and stand for that, for the flag, for the national anthem, in reference of those who did sacrifice for us. And when Hillary Clinton says it's disrespectful to the country, and she is siting, with cop haters. Unfortunately, this controversy is not going away anytime soon. The only thing leaving are the fans and also sponsors. 
The man who started all of this, former 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, he filed a grievance against the NFL saying, NFL owners are blacklisting him. And guess what? Kaepernick is taking a page out of the left-wing playbook and he is actually blaming President Trump. You can't make this up. 
Now, Kaepernick's attorney Mark Geragos, I've known him for years, smart attorney. He released a statement on behalf of his client. It reads in part, quote, ""If the NFL (as well as all professional sports league) is to remain a meritocracy than principled and peaceful political protests -- which the owners themselves made great theater imitating weeks ago -- should not be punished and athlete should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the Executive Branch of our government.""
This is beyond ridiculous. By the way, who is Colin Kaepernick to lecture us? Keep in mind. Kaepernick gave money to a charity that defends a cop killer. Kaepernick wore socks depicting cops as pigs. He openly supported a communist, murdering thug dictator Fidel Castro, but somehow at its President Trump's fault that the NFL doesn't want any part of him? 
And also, while Kaepernick did have a great career early in his career, people saw his throwing regressing, his skills diminishing. Also reports from some of his teammates that though he was selfish and arrogant. Remember, football is a team sport. But now Kaepernick wants to force all NFL teams or one NFL team to hire him? That's not how this world works. 
And I also want to put something into perspective here. While people are now demanding that Colin Kaepernick gets a job, there are real American heroes that are going under reported. Guess what? According to the FBI, new numbers in 2016 alone, 118 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty, protecting all of us. And over 57,000 were assaulted, protecting us. Those are the people that should be honored while the national anthem is being played along with our brave troops. 
Joining us now in reaction, he was a member of the Trump transition team, the Reverend Darrell Scott is with us. And also civil rights attorney Daryl Parks. 
Reverend Scott, let me start with you and get your general reaction. For all of her life, Hillary Clinton, all of her life has enabled her husband who had severe problems with women, even accused of rape. And she was part of an effort to smear, slander, besmirch. We are going to get lectured by her on this issue? And she's not even giving the money back to the Clinton Foundation? 
REV. DARRELL SCOTT, NEW SPIRIT REVIVAL CENTER: Well, you know, Hillary Clinton, she's always trying to embrace victimization. I mean, the only victims she doesn't side with are the victims of her husband's impropriety. But, you know, she refrained from commenting on Harvey Weinstein for so many days. Because she just didn't know what to say. Because she was aware of what he was doing. And then everyone of them, her and the rest of Hollywood out of fear reprisal, until he got fired, they would not reply. Once he was fired, they felt the coast was clear. And they all had the same lame excuse. Oh, I was so shocked that I didn't know what to say. Well, you know, that's garbage. 
HANNITY: She enabled their smearing. 
SCOTT: Yes.
HANNITY: Daryl Parks, let me go to you. If a country that tells women how to dress, won't let them drive or won't let them vote, where marital rape is not a crime, domestic abuse is not a crime, women cannot travel or leave the house without man's permission, gays and lesbians are killed as a matter of law in many of these countries and Christians and Jews were persecuted. My question, Daryl Parks, would you take a penny from countries that abuse human rights like that? 
DARYL PARKS, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, Sean I think we have to -- 
HANNITY: Answer that. That's a yes or no. Oh, you've got to answer. 
PARKS: I don't think it's a ""yes"" or ""no"" question. 
HANNITY: It is a yes or no. Will you take it or not? 
(CROSSTALK)
PARKS: -- of what people are doing in this country. I would be very concerned -- 
HANNITY: Would you take money from the best charity you work for? I know for example, Pastor Scott has a great charity in Cleveland, that I want to support his charity. OK. Would you take money from a country that abuses women, kills gays and lesbians and persecutes Christians and Jews? Do you want that dirty, filthy money? I don't. 
PARKS: Yes. I think you've got to -- 
HANNITY: Do you want it. Would you take it? 
PARKS: I think you've got to be very concerned about it. Very concerned about --
HANNITY: But would you take it? That would be a concern. Would you take the millions from those countries they are offering it to you? 
PARKS: You probably wouldn't. 
HANNITY: You wouldn't. 
PARKS: You probably wouldn't. 
HANNITY: Hillary did, Pastor Scott. That is the point. Millions. And they bought her silence on the abuse of all of these different groups that she claims she has a monopoly on. 
SCOTT: Yes. And you know, Hillary, it was supposed to be her platform. Women's empowerment. So, how can you take money from someone who is oppose to the platform that you profess to stand on? She's a fraud. She's been a fraud. She is always been a fraud.
PARKS: Those are strong words.
SCOTT: Hillary is a fraud. Hillary is a fraud. 
HANNITY: Let me play it to you. We have little Jimmy, crazy Uncle Jimmy Kimmel. I want to play this tape. Him doing a show asking girls as young as 18 to use their hands to figure out what is in his pants. And to use their mouths. This is the same guy that feigns, you know, moral superiority and outrage over topics, he didn't have one joke about Weinstein. Let's roll the tape. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""THE MAN SHOW""/ COMEDY CENTRAL, 2002) 
JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST: This game show is called ""Guess What's In My Pants."" Now, I've stuffed something in my pants. You are allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants. You have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants. You ready? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Set. 
KIMMEL: Go. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It looks like -- 
KIMMEL: You should use two hands. Two hands --
 (LAUGHTER) 
You're going to make a fine wife. All right. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right there? 
KIMMEL: Yes. How old are you? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Eighteen. 
KIMMEL: OK. Are you sure of that? 
Because Uncle Jimmy doesn't need to do time. Maybe it would be easier if you put your mouth on it. You've got a nice technique there. You could get in the Olympics with this. Let me tell you.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Is that Uncle Jimmy creepy? 
SCOTT: How perverted is that? Who thought of that skit? Those are like the most disgusting, perverted skit that you ever want to see in your life. 
HANNITY: Yes. 
PARKS: It certainly should be on television. 
HANNITY: What's that? 
PARKS: Certainly that is not the type of thing we want to see on television especially when you have young women watching. That's just not the type of television we want to see in our country. 
HANNITY: All right. We've got to run here. Pastor Scott, I'm going to be at your church. 
SCOTT: Yes.
HANNITY: I'm going to be in Dallas on Sunday morning, Robert Jeffers' church. And then I will be in your church 6:00 on Sunday night. I hear it's getting a lot of play up in Cleveland. 
SCOTT: Oh, yes. It's getting a lot of play. A lot of people are excited. I got a lot of friends coming. It's going to be a great time. God is going to move that night through Sean Hannity. 
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: There are better options for God, I'm telling you. He could do better than little Sean Hannity. Trust me. We'll see you then. I look forward to it. And thank you both. When we come back, we have a big announcement about breaking news coming up tonight. 
Plus, just how bad is the Casting Couch problem in Hollywood for people that want to be in movies, on TV, and the music industry and others? Two women who have experienced firsthand how awful it is. Well, they will share their stories with you, next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: And welcome back to HANNITY. And so, my opening monologue, I detailed the Casting Couch culture throughout Hollywood, the music business, the TV business. Now in the case of Harvey Weinstein, we have yet another morning from over ten years ago. Nobody paid attention. Here's what Courtney Love said about Weinstein back in 2005. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have any advice for young girls in Hollywood? 
COURTNEY LOVE, MUSICIAN: I'll get libeled if I say it. If Harvey Weinstein invites you in a private party in the Four Seasons, don't go. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Recording artist Kaya Jones is also calling out the music industry. Kaya used to be a member of the Pussycat Dolls, she tweeted this weekend. ""My truth, I wasn't in a girl group, I was in a prostitution ring. Oh, and we happen to sing and be famous while everyone who owned us made the money. We reached out to the founder of the Pussycat Dolls, Robin Antin and she denies what Kaya Jones was saying. 
Here with reaction, recording artist, Kaya Jones. Actress, Tracy Melchior is with us. Kaya, how old were you when you first got into music? 
KAYA JONES, RECORDING ARTIST: I was 12 when I first got signed. 
HANNITY: Wow. 
JONES: Yes.
HANNITY: And how quickly did the predators begin to move in? 
JONES: Well, I think that is the thing, they didn't move in right away for me. I didn't receive anything until I was 18 years old and I joined the Pussycat Dolls. So, I think, had I not had a career before that where I knew that there are people with integrity, it wouldn't have probably been alarming but it was super alarming because I had been in the business and never had any advances. 
HANNITY: And when you say it's a prostitution ring, those are strong words and people want to understand this. 
JONES: Well, you know, when you have a den mother from how that's controlling the girls, manipulating the mind and verbally and mentally abusive, what's the difference between that and attempt in order to control the narrative. That's what was done on a day to day basis by Miss Antin. And furthermore, you know, it was a constant thing of being attacked in the back of cars and innuendos by different executives. She knew and everyone in the group went through it. 
HANNITY: In other words, you were attacked by those people that had all the power over you and it was on a regular basis? 
JONES: Yes. And I had to decide for myself, my moral compass. I walked away at 21 years old from a massive conglomerate that was launching us into orbit. How bad could it be for a 21-year-old to walk away from her dream? 
HANNITY: Yes.
JONES: I knew I was standing on a limb. 
HANNITY: Tracy, I know you spent years and you are on ""The Bold and The Beautiful"" and many of these successful daytime shows. And you had a horrific time. Why don't you tell us what happened? 
TRACY MELCHIOR, AUTHOR, BREAKING THE PERFECT 10: Well, first of all, I want to be clear, none of my experiences were with my producers during soaps. I had lovely producers there. It was prior to that. But the entertainment industry attracts a lot of women who are looking for validation and approval. And in my case, male attention that I did not get home from a father. 
And so, you can buy that with wealthy men who are in a position to advance your career and I think one of the things I think that's really important is at that time, I think I had a false idol of fame and fortune. So, I was willing to sacrifice and do whatever it took for that. And it's interesting how people can sense that or something because I was put into so many situations whereas my friends, who maybe weren't as vulnerable, they seemed to, you know, get around it. But for me, it was, I fell into situations that I was vulnerable to, for sure. 
HANNITY: And you got raped. 
MELCHIOR: I did. Not in Hollywood. That was prior. At 16. And I think that what happens is like, it doesn't just start when you get to Hollywood, I think a lot of it happens before we get there. It's almost like, I was groomed prior to getting to Hollywood, to be the perfect candidate for these producers and directors, which I did end up falling victim to. I hate that word, victim. But -- 
HANNITY: You know, it seems like this, I will ask both of you this. Tracy, we'll start with you. Young girls, maybe before they are 18, around 18. They have dreams. They want to be the music industry. They want to be on television. They want to be in the movie industry. 
MELCHIOR: Yes.
HANNITY: How common is this? That basically, they are told it's a quid pro quo. You want a movie role. You want to get in the band. You want a chance, you have to go through us first. Tracy. 
MELCHIOR: For me, it was never that blatant. 
HANNITY: Was a subtle but obvious though? 
MELCHIOR: Well, it was like, you knew who could get you a job. You knew who this director was by name. You knew who this producer was. And if they are inviting you to dinner or to something, you are like oh, my gosh, this is great. Because you're thinking it's regarding your career. 
HANNITY: And then you get to dinner and what's happening in most cases at dinner? They reveal their true intentions? 
MELCHIOR: Well, honestly, Sean, a lot of these dinners, I was not the only girl there. There were many. It was, you know, a flock. And it was just a selection process. I guess. 
HANNITY: Wow!
MELCHIOR: And I think that it was -- you were actually -- I was, I think it was a compliment that you were chosen and I was just so vulnerable for wanting that validation and approval. 
HANNITY: You wrote a great book, by the way. ""Breaking the Perfect 10"" about the Ten Commandments and getting your life back. And I thought it was great.
MELCHIOR: Thank you.
HANNITY: Kaya, how frequent do they play on the ambitions or the dreams of young people, that you have seen in all the years you've been doing this? 
JONES: Yes. Well, there are good people in this business too, Sean. But ultimately, there are a lot of predators in this business. We've heard the stories from Corey Feldman, we've heard the stories from Corey Haim, we've heard, you know, Tom Petty has a song called ""Joe,"" talking about, you know, getting a young girl and a young boy and making money off of them and controlling them. It's a scary thing. 
This is what needs to happen is, women need to continue to speak out. Girls in my group, girls in other groups, or in entertainment, period, needs to speak out. Because you can take out the trash at that point. 
HANNITY: All right. Last question.
JONES: There are good people too. 
HANNITY: Are the people that are creepy well known? Does everybody know? 
JONES: Most know. It depends on the company. It depends on the company. Not all companies are bad. There are select companies that have men that push things on young girls. You are impressionable. You are a young woman. 
HANNITY: And the political side of it, you know like the Clintons, Hillary Clinton did not say a word about her husband. Now she is lecturing us on all these issues. She takes money from these countries that abused women. Persecute Christians and Jews. And kill gays and lesbians. She will sanctimoniously lecture everyone else and accuse Mitt Romney of misogyny, because he had literally resumes of women he wanted to hire. But she slandered him. Neither one of you deserve that. I am glad you are speaking out. Hopefully this horrible practice stops. We appreciated. Thank you. 
JONES: Thank you Sean. 
HANNITY: When we come back, President Trump has very sharp words for the NFL players disrespecting our flag and later, a big announcement. Big breaking news coming up this week. Will tell you about it. When we come back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: The NFL should have suspended some of these players for one game. Not fire them, suspended them for one game and if they did it again, it could have been two games in three games and then for the season. We wouldn't have people disrespecting our country right now. The people of our country are very angry at the NFL. You just have to look at their ratings and at their stadiums. You see empty seats where you never saw them before. A lot of people are very angry at it. It's highly disrespectful and they should not do it. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: The president was right and that was him, earlier today, slamming NFL players that continue to kneel during our national anthem. Here with reaction, former NFL player in super bowl winner Burgess Owens, also with us the spokesperson for the national association of police athletic activities league as well as the CEO of the Brewer group former NFL player Jack Brewer is with us and also on the legal ide of this we have Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett is with us. Mr. Brewer let me start with you. You are aware that in the NFL, there was a player on the 15th anniversary of 9/11 who wanted to put the date on his cleats. I don't think anyone on TV could see it. 9/11/01, never forget. You know you can't twerk or shoot a fake bow and arrow in the end zone, there plenty of restrictions of free speech and the NFL. You understand that, right? 
JACK BREWER, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Of course I do, Sean. Of course. The question in that situation goes a lot deeper than that. We can continue to focus on these things but we all know that the national football league and players aren't trying to disrespect the flag. I am with you. I'd probably stand up with our flag as well, honor our soldiers and military. It goes back to what are the actual solution, we keep having this debate? We are not identified with the solutions are. 
HANNITY: I am willing to help out and donate to the right charity, considerate inner-City kids. 
BREWER: Sean I know you had. I know, you are a great man for that. I love your approach to that. I'm asking you, we have the ear of the President. Look at the African-American players like myself -- to have these conversations. 
HANNITY: We can't unite on the men that fought, bled, and died fighting under that flag. 
BREWER: Agreed. 
HANNITY: And not respect that. We can't get the square one, Burgess. 
BREWER: A vast majority of the NFL players agree. 
BURGESS OWENS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: I agree, Jack. We need to find solutions. Our problem, we are having a problem, the organization that has indoctrinated our players with anti-white, anti-flag, anti-American. Everything you see on the sidelines today has gone to our communities. Black entertainment television. Its white people with a black facade, black employees with a message that is anti-American. We have all these kids growing up in this environment, they're going to believe what they want to believe. We are up against a very evil ideology, guys. We understand that. Pulling these guys from behind their corporate board rooms. Explain what they are doing to us. 
HANNITY: And a way, did the NFL and sports in general, really help unite us in this country? Isn't there one area that transcends all race? I remember players after games, they get in the circle, even the refs and they say a prayer together. Which I thought was really cool after you saw the best of the best, most talented athletes. They got along. The fans, there was no was no black and white. No black, white, Hispanic. Just great players and fans that loved talented people. 
OWENS: You are describing a Christian values that the country has built on in every generation became better and better. We are learning to look each other inside out. Not outside in. It's against our American ways. There are people that love the fact that our young people -- they grew up hating white people in the flag. They grow their power. They sit back and let it happen because they prospered from this process. It's a great conversation. 
HANNITY: In that sense, I think we can come up and jack, you might be right on this. And in the end, maybe we will come up with some good solutions otherwise the NFL will be over. People will not go anymore. Colin Kaepernick, Gregg is the guy that supports a charity that supports a cop killer. Cops depicted as pigs on his socks. Supports a murdering thug dictator. He got it started. Now he thinks the league owes him a position. And his lawyer said is it diminished skills or the politics that owners are rejecting? 
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: He cannot win this case because under the collective bargaining agreement, he has to prove a conspiracy among team owners to prevent him from playing. It has to be verbal or written. He has no ability to prove that because he cannot compel witnesses or subpoena documents. 
HANNITY: She is trying to get documents from everybody in the league. Do you have a random ability to do that? 
JARRETT: No, you do not. The collective bargaining agreement says it's on Kaepernick. Simply showing that he is a qualified player and unsigned is not enough. To prove conspiracy and collusion. 
HANNITY: Do you think Jack or Burgess that this is a conspiracy against Colin Kaepernick? 
BREWER: I think it is way deeper than that. I don't think you can say it's strictly a conspiracy. I think the business owners -- I call them business owners because that is what they are, they are looking out for their bottom line at the end of the day. 
HANNITY: Is there anything wrong with that? 
BREWER: This is America. I'm a businessman myself. 
HANNITY: Maybe he needs to experience some demonstration because he needs to take a knee to pray to god. 
BREWER: At the end of the day, the man should be able to protest if he wants to. I don't agree with it but -- 
JARRETT: It's your first amendment right to engage in free speech on the work space. They are on the job in uniform on the field. At work. Supreme Court has repeatedly say you have no first amendment protection in the workplace. 
OWENS: I have to negotiate what I can say -- it's contract time. In order to get a job, people have to like you. In the employees have to feel that you are a good return on investment. Forget that. 
HANNITY: I will donate money, I will do anything I can do. Especially if we can help the murders in Chicago. 
BREWER: That means enough. We need to have conversations. Set that meeting. 
OWENS: The American way. This is what we do best. Support each other. 
HANNITY: And then we can play ball. And honor our troops and our flag. Coming up next, the President is fulfilling his campaign promises. Totally decimating and dismantling Obama's legacy. Sebastian Gorka, Austan Goolsbee are next. Also, big breaking news coming week. Tick tock, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
STEVE BANNON, FORMER CHIEF STRATEGIST TO THE WHITE HOUSE: This is not my war. This is our war. You all didn't start it. The establishment started it. But I will tell you one thing, you all are going to finish it. There is a time and season for everything. Now, it is a season of war against the GOP establishment. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Steve Bannon over the weekend saying he is going to war with the GOP establishment. We saw it in Alabama. Today President Trump said Bannon has a lot of points, but he is going to try to work with Mitch McConnell in the interim. The author of the best-selling book ""defeating Jihad."" The make America great again. Coalition chief strategist, the former deputy assistant to the President, Sebastian Gorka and former Obama economic advisor, close friend of ""Hannity,"" Austan Goolsbee is with us. 
Austan, I know you're going to like a little of this but your Party has zero vision and when there's no vision or insight, the people perish. We've already perished under Obama. I want to say this, I am with Steve Bannon in this sense. We cannot lose control of the house and senate. If Mitch McConnell cannot do his job, go, get out. Let's not elect people that aren't bold and are going to fight to get the job done. What they did on health care was a disgrace. 
SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Look at the last nine months. What has the GOP establishment done for this President? On November 8th, the people of America chose. They chose a person who is antiestablishment, and had a very clear message on Obamacare, national security, the border, economic security, what has the GOP done? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
HANNITY: There something amazing that is happening. On climate and trade, look what he did last week. On his own on health care, brilliant and is going to help every American. Then you have the benefit of corporations. Buying across state lines. 
GORKA: It's funny, after the speech -- 
HANNITY: By the way, your speech was great. 
GORKA: Thank you, they're half a dozen true Trump white people afterwards. And I said to them, who is giving the President advice on Obamacare, and they said you know what? Nobody. He is getting the opposite advice and what is he doing? Like a steam train. He is blasting through. 
HANNITY: he is dismantling the entire Obama legacy, almost single- handedly. Now, Austan I've got a question for you. What is the Democratic vision for the country? What did they want to do for the country? Give us the top five items. Go. 
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR AT CHICAGO'S BOOTH SCHOOLS OF BUSINESS: Look, I think what they want to do and or should want to do -- an argument within the Democratic Party. Number one, restore wage growth to working people. 
HANNITY: You mean like Obama did? OK. Two? 
GOOLSBEE: Yes, the last three years of Obama -- 
HANNITY: Only 13 million more on food stamps. 8 million more on poverty. What number to go? 
GOOLSBEE: You're quoting numbers from three years ago. 
HANNITY: I am quoting numbers for the eight years of Obama. Keep him accountable. 
GOOLSBEE: Maintain the expansion of health care. 
HANNITY: Oh, grow Obamacare? What's number three? 
GORKA: It would be great. It would be great for us. 
GOOLSBEE: I'd run from office. My point is with President Obama and with President Bush and with President Clinton, all three of them had major legislative accomplishments in their first year. Donald Trump has none. She is fighting with his own Party. 
HANNITY: I actually think it is healthy. I'm going to tell you why. Dr. Gorka, if I think politicians are all governed by fear, I saw a very fearful Mitch McConnell today. I think the reason Corker got out was he knew he was going to get primary. That is why he is now lashing out. 
GORKA: The winds of change. They are worried. We rattle their cage and this is the right message to send. The left does what they do and that is fine. We expect the left to do it. But when our side says they have our values get selected him and betrays us and does nothing in Capitol Hill? That is the bigger obstacle. 
HANNITY: You know one truth and I will say this top Austan, Austan I will give your party credit. You guys sticks together through thick and thin and there is no one person that waivers. Republicans are not like that. When are the other three big visions? Expanding Obamacare? In the economic disaster? 
GOOLSBEE: How can you not dwell on the fact that the Republican governor has now come out and said what Donald Trump is proposing on health care would be catastrophic? 
Corporations have had this since 1974 where they could buy, because they had opposite in different cities. They are not subject to state rules or Obamacare rules. They can buy in bulk at lower prices, better plans, across state lines with more competition including cooperatives. 
GOOLSBEE: So let's have some bipartisan ideas. Don't just go light everything you can see on fire. 
HANNITY: Supporting Democrats -- you just oppose him because they breathe. If he gave every American a million dollars. 
GOOLSBEE: Even Republicans are saying -- 
GORKA: If he walked on water, they would say he can't swim. 
(CROSSTALK) 
HANNITY: But he can't give us the five ideas because (inaudible) 
(CROSSTALK) 
GORKA: I went on Fox business earlier today and I said look at the economy, the last 28 records? The host said we broke the 46th record. 
HANNITY: You just lost jobs for the first time in 17 years. 
GORKA: Historic records. That is good for everybody. You don't have to have shares. If you've got a retirement plan, you are making money. We've increased by a quarter the wealth of the stock market. 
HANNITY: By the way, Austan, you were a part of the foundational team for the Obama economy. How is it that the first President in American history to accumulate more debt than any other President before him combined, A and B never reach one year of his presidency, 3 percent GDP growth and double the debt? 
GOOLSBEE: There's one significant break from the Obama legacy that I will admit. In the time that Donald Trump has been in office, job creation has been about 20 percent lower than it was last year. 
HANNITY: A million new jobs. Wake up, where you living? Chicago, that is why. 
GOOLSBEE: Just look at the numbers, Sean. We are growing at about 1.1 million jobs. 
HANNITY: Last point Sebastian. 
GORKA: The President, the people on the outside, myself in the make America great coalition, we are dismantling of Obama's disastrous legacy brick by brick, joins us. 
HANNITY: I am in. McConnell, get on board or get out of the way. Up next, a big announcement. You're going to want to hear this. Straight a go ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
HANNITY: Two years ago I started working on a very special project, life in Hollywood sucks and they won't make movies we want to see that inspire us. We are very proud of the film called ""Let There Be Light"" it will be in theaters in 11 days on October 27th. A movie the whole family can enjoy. I think this will move you and to find locations, it's on hannity.com. In theaters near you. Take a quick look.

"Kerry's Nomination: Accept, or Deflect?",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2004/06/02/kerrys-nomination-accept-or-deflect.html,"

John Kerry (search) is expected to decide this week whether he will delay accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, his timetable moved up under pressure from party officials.






Several advisers want him to forgo the nomination at the Democratic convention in late July and wait five weeks until President Bush accepts the GOP nod. That would give both candidates the same time to spend $75 million in public money set aside for the general election.
Kerry had planned to wait several weeks before deciding what to do, but word of his deliberations leaked last week, forcing his hand. Campaign officials began telling fellow Democrats on Tuesday that a decision should come in the next day or two.

Kerry's nomination: Accept, or deflect?
A sample of your responses:
If Kerry won't accept the convention's nomination then the delegates should nominate someone else.



 Kirk C.
 Oakwood, GA
As a resident of a so-called ""battleground state,"" I've endured more of Bush's negative attacks ads than Kerry's more positive ads for months. Five extra weeks of outlandish campaign spending by the president would be too much.
 Mary C.
 Palm Harbor, FL
It's just another way of the Democrats cheating again. Plus, the convention goers might nominate someone else who will accept the nomination at their convention.
 Mindy B.
 Fayetteville, AR
Knowing that his chances of winning are slim and knowing how Hilary fears campaigning they will stall until the last minute when he will refuse the nomination. Then, those rascally Demos will insert Hilary in the slot having avoided many interviews, spending her money, etc. Ah, the Clintons.
 John M.
 Hallandale Beach, FL
When referring to the amount of money each party has donated, the democrats say they want to level the playing field. The playing field has always been level. Each party has had the same opportunity to donate money. It appears the republicans believe more in their cause than the Democrats. Stop whining, Kerry, and accept the nomination.
 C.J. Meadows
Gee, since Kerry appears to be such an elitist, maybe the Democrats should ""crown him king"" instead of just nominating him for president at the convention.
 Earline E.
 Rogersville, TN
Considering that the Democrats picked the date for their convention, one has to wonder about their organizational skills when the funding issue becomes a problem. Or perhaps the can't read a calendar? He should accept as soon as possible...
