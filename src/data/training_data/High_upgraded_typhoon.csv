DavidTaylorNYC,"@annamousse @wxonly @CarolineH1027 @WunderCave @askaboutcoins1 We had both the 2.8 and the 4.3 litre. We worked on a buddy's Syclone (upgraded Typhoon) which was based on the Blazer/Jimmy. Did 0-60 in 3.6 seconds and at the time was faster than a Corvette or Testarossa by at least a second.

And could tow a full-sized trailer. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",,Thu Aug 09 16:39:48 +0000 2018
