tonidevine2,@realDonaldTrump Please consider starting a Fire Force.  Perhaps designate a section of an existing Air Force Base in the Midwest that is suitable for several Super Tankers for fighting fires.  I say the Midwest due to central location which they can depart to either direction.,,Wed Aug 15 21:02:49 +0000 2018
