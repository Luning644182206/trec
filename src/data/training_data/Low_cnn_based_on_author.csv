lawrence_author,.@jimsciutto @PARISDENNARD Access to classified is based on a need to know basis. I've had them. That's simply how it works. #CNN needs to have a Trump supporter on who knows what's he talking about. I'll wait...,,Sat Aug 18 04:23:49 +0000 2018

pr_1715,"@FridaGhitis @thehill Of all of the ""terrible headlines"" provided by ""The Hill, CNN, MSNBC, etc, this is an odd one to show concern about.  Especially from a ""columnist, author, CNN Opinion""

Based on the impression that Waters herself generates, wouldn't Trump be rightly expressing an opinion?",,Wed Aug 15 16:07:22 +0000 2018
pattyannval1,"@DJKing_IsHipHop @DudBailey @SkidCrease @realDonaldTrump @CNN The quote is from a book written about LBJ, Inside the Whitehouse. Did he say it? Only the author knows for sure but based on other things he's said it's not out of character.",,Mon Aug 13 21:08:14 +0000 2018
MarsDorian,@stillgray That isn't the content of the argument. You attributed a statement to CNN when it was expressed by an author featured in an article. It's the kind of skewed reporting you accuse MSM of. I'm all for diversity of thought but counterpoints are only strong if they're based on truth.,,Wed Aug 08 18:10:56 +0000 2018
