UncommonSense50,I am a native Californian from San Joaquin Valley. The Dems have removed water from 1000s of acres of farmland &amp; destroyed lives. Drive the roads-miles of dead walnut/apricot/peach trees. Dems are spending BILLIONS on a bullet train noone wants vs a WATER tunnel everyone needs. https://t.co/Cu0jJrXMIH,,Wed Aug 08 16:30:22 +0000 2018
